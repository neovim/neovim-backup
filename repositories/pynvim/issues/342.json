Though this will more or less be callback hell and thus have none of the benefits of _either_ the stackful greenlet approach or the explicitly yieldable approach of asyncio coroutines. \r\n\r\nRather what I would imagine useful is to reimplement the python client using _only_ asyncio and native coroutines and no greenlets, I suspect that will be a lot simpler than the exisiting multi-layer client: it will more or less be a library providing a `nvim` asyncio protocol for its native transports, and request awaitables for coroutines which asyncio otherwise manages by itself.",

I wouldn't even think \"fork\", rather new codebase which can happen to borrow code from this where it makes sense. Starting from scratch with no regards of vim compatibility (which necessitates a sync-like interface backed by greenlets or similar) would give a lot more freedom for both simplicity and expressivity. For instance `call_atomic` could be exposed as a function converting multiple request awaitables to a single awaitable, while with this codebase to use `call_atomic` you must throw all existing abstractions above the raw API out through the window.",
