    "body": "As a plugin developer I would like to use libraries from the currently active Python virtual environment in my Neovim plugin. For example, when I'm working on a Django project I don't have Django installed globally, instead I have Django installed in my virtual environment. Then I could do something like `:python import django`. However, `pynvim-python` points to the `python` of the virtual environment where it was installed to, not the currently active one, so it cannot find Django.\n\nWhat is the solution? I could install pynvim into the current virtual environment as well. Then in my plugin I would have to do something like this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import django\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError:\n    print('Cannot find Django. Did you install pynvim into your virtual environment?')\n    # And whatever else\n```\n\nIs this the way forward?",
