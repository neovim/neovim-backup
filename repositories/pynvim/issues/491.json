    "body": "Hi Everyone,\r\nI did some research, looked through the test files and an issue about Windows connection over named pipes. Unfortunately, I still do not know how to approach the following case:\r\n\r\n* I am developing a screen reader add-on that will improve interaction,\r\n* I need to connect to the launched instance of Neovim in the TUI mode,\r\n\r\nI could ask the users to make some configuration changes, but maybe it is not required, for the screen reader API returns the following information:\r\n\r\nappModule: <'nvim' (appName 'nvim', process ID 10092) at address 43c3db0>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I get the process ID and so on. Here are my ideas and questions:\r\n\r\n* Can I use the process ID to connect to this particular instance,\r\n* It is the instance launched by the user with the screen reader add-on/module attached,\r\n* What would be the code to connect to this session?\r\n* How can I query and get notified of Neovim mode changes?\r\n\r\nThe rational for this add-on is the following:\r\n\r\n* Screen readers work in a similar manner as VIM: browse/focus modes like normal/insert modes,\r\n* When VIM is in normal mode the commands change the caret and/or selection, but the screen reader is not notified,\r\n* I need to know what is the current VIM mode so I can write screen reader scripts to query for text changes,\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help and feedback...",
