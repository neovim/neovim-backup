    "body": "In order to use and test out pynvim it would be beneficial to have a startup script for IPython that populates a connection to a local NeoVim instance without further setup required. \r\nAt least in  Arch Linux AFAIK every NeoVim instance populates its API endpoint under /tmp/nvimRANDOM/0. This makes it possible to connect to every instance, echo a identifying message to the user to enable him/her choosing to which instance to connect to. If there is only one instance it is also possible to connect to it directly. \r\nI created a small script that implements the above mentioned behviour. Is this interesting to anyone else?\r\n Example:\r\n![Peek 2019-05-02 22-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3208694/57103711-d3234680-6d26-11e9-8aaa-11a398586ffd.gif)\r\n",

Here's something similar in my config: https://github.com/justinmk/config/blob/ad5b792049b352274d4cbd3525a2aff6ce296a7e/.config/nvim/init.vim#L1339-L1361\r\n\r\nI think it might be a good idea to have some sort of convention where each client implements something like this. Then the user can just `rpcrequest({chan}, 'repl')`.\r\n\r\nOr it could simply be a plugin included with Nvim core runtime.",
