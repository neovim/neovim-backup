A client created from a socket will prevent the node process from exiting.\n\n\n`nvim.transport.writer.end()` appears to work (at-least with a socket) but `transport` is private. I can also pass a socket as reader/writer and close that, but then I need to keep a references to the socket and client.\n\n Should there be `detatch` method on NeovimClient, or [Symbol.asyncDispose](https://v8.dev/features/explicit-resource-management) for `await using client = attach({ socket })`?",

It's quite possible that this was overlooked because typically the process just exits and takes the clients with it.\n\n`dispose()` sounds like what we want since `detach()` implies that the client isn't destroyed and could be re-attached?\n\nPR very welcome!",
