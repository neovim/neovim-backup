(idk what's involved with publishing to crates)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help here including setting up automatic publishing through a Github action, since I have a decent background in Rust library development and crate publishing. The main challenge today with publishing is that you still need to tie crates to an owner. Not sure if neovim has any generic account that the core maintainers have access to.\r\n\r\nFrom [discussion about publishing](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/create-a-crates-io-token-for-a-github-team/58637/7):\r\n> On [crates.io](http://crates.io/), crates are owned by individual users who log in directly with their personal GitHub account. Teams don't own crates and \"team owners\" are just an authorization mechanism that allows other GitHub users (who are part of the GH team, but not necessarily [crates.io](http://crates.io/) crate owners) to publish new releases.\r\n>\r\n> In all cases interaction with [crates.io](http://crates.io/) is done via personal GitHub accounts, not via team/org account.",
