The `/.well-known/` is a [convention for web services to expose specific information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI). In this particular case - verify that `neovim.io` URL is associated with `did:plc:635xovhsdw27inbgxukm3qtp` [Decentralized identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier) used for ATProto services (like Bluesky). Currently [it shows \"Invalid handle\"](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:635xovhsdw27inbgxukm3qtp) because it can not verify this. This also means that link `https://bsky.app/profile/neovim.io` stopped working.\n\nIf resolving this is for some reason not possible, there is a way to do the same with DNS record. Here is [the guide](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial). Relevant step is to create the DNS record of TXT type for the `neovim.io` address:\n\n- Set the domain: _atproto\n- Set the type: TXT\n- Set the value field (also sometimes called “data”): `did=did:plc:635xovhsdw27inbgxukm3qtp`\n\nThis should create a domain record at `_atproto.`. After this is done, please ping me so that I can trigger verification.\n\nExposing `/.well-known/atproto-did` looks more preferable to me since it improves the bus factor, but DNS record also works.",

I am trying to look into it, but it is hard to debug without knowing which GitHub Pages config is currently in use. The file is indeed served locally, but not on GitHub Pages.\n\nThe solution here seems to be to put a `.nojekyll` file in the root of the served site. The `gh-pages` branch [does contain it at the moment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/tree/gh-pages), but I also notice that it is not up to date with `main` branch. Commits are five hours older and it says \"serving 12837fc1032cc46fa2c6d73e1179b6644a0d9acc\".\n\nThis makes me think that deployment is not done from `gh-pages` now, which I think is the most straightforward way to handle this.
