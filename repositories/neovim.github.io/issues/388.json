Which left the choice of either going darker or lighter for basic site's background while reusing already present palette from 'mini.hues'. Decided to go darker for dark theme and lighter for light theme.\n\nThis can be reversed for neovim.io: get normal background and adjust it similarly to how 'mini.hues' does it: add approximately 5 lightness while preserving chroma and hue in OKLch color space. So:\n- Basic background is `#0f191f`, which is [lightness 11, chroma 2, hue 235](https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/#0f191f).\n- Adjusted color is Lightness 16, chroma 2, hue 235, i.e. `#1c262d`.\n\nHere is how code blocks will look like with `#1c262d` as a background:\n\n- Before/now: \n\n<img width=\"2202\" height=\"1574\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e74f359-3fed-49b2-a629-90da01ef0c95\" />\n\n- After:\n\n<img width=\"2182\" height=\"1563\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb2945ae-8785-4c94-b87e-a083a789aa2f\" />\n\nI don't think I have a preference here. The \"after\" might be better without border though.\n\nIf you have any suggestions about how you'd like to adjust the color or have questions about nvim-mini.org site, I am happy to help.",
