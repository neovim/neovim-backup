I'm a frontend developer and I'd like to contribute to a redesign of neovim.io, my favorite editor.\n\n## Current issues:\n\n- **Disorganized layout** – landing page, sponsors and news sections lack clear hierarchy\n\n- **Poor project structure** - lots of stuff in the root, flat file organization\n\n- **Visual inconsistency** - poorly adjusted and meaningless spacing\n\n## Proposed solution:\n\n- **Modern technology** - Astro (static generation, optimal performance)\n\n- Component-based architecture with suitable file structure\n\n- Maintains Neovim's visual identity while improving UX\n\nI'm working on it and hope to have a prototype ready in 2-3 days. I would appreciate any feedback on requirements or constraints before going too far.\nThanks!",
