Currently studying [gen_help_html.lua](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/gen_help_html.lua).\n\nMy goal is to produce a good-looking PDF of the user manual (`usr_*.txt`), using a script that can be easily run after each Neovim release.\n\nThe current attempts (https://github.com/jkbr-19/neovim-pdf-manual mentioned above, https://github.com/HugoForrat/LaTeX-Vim-User-Manual for Vim) use HTML as the input, but we'd get better results if we wrote LaTeX the same way we're writing HTML in that script. Which I think is what the comment above is getting at!\n\n",
