    "body": "# Problem\n\nWhen looking for terminfo behavior, most users are going to read the `terminfo (5)` manual provided by ncurses.\nThe issue arises with difference in descriptions search between ncurses and unibilium.\nIndeed, there are major differences around the `TERMINFO_DIRS` environment variable.\nncurses supports empty entries and will search for compiled builtins (e.g. system directory) if searching the `TERMINFO_DIRS` list fails.\n\nThe issue is exacerbated by the following:\n - main consumer of unibilium, neovim, does not provide any information on search failure\n - vim itself relies on ncurses\n - usual recommended tools for terminfo \"tinkering\", such as `infocmp`, will behaves as ncurses, not as unibilium\n - unibilium behavior around descriptions search is buried under non intuitive manpage titled `unibi_from_term`\n\n# Step to reproduce\n\n - set a `TERMINFO_DIRS` that relies on empty entry or fallback to system directory search, such as:\n   - `export TERMINFO_DIRS=/nonexistant:`\n   - `export TERMINFO_DIRS=$HOME/.terminfo_not_containing_specific_TERM`\n - start `nvim -c q`\n\n# Expected behavior\n\nunibilium behaves similarly to ncurses regarding descriptions search.\n\n# Current behavior\n\nThe descriptions search fails, disabling features such as terminal alternate screen.\n",
