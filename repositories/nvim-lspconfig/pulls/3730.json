I split the commits up (mostly correctly) into LSPs that had more than 1 root_marker and LSPs that had `.git` as their only root marker, I wasn't sure if we'd end up wanting to keep the `.git` marker on there if its all there is? Also the `nixd` LSP has a root_marker of `git` instead of `.git`, I don't know anything about nixd so didn't touch it, but maybe that was a typo?",

If `.git` is the last item in `root_markers` it will be evaluated only if other markers aren't found in every directory going up to root.\r\n\r\nyeah i was wondering about that. I think #3728 was motivated by the mere *presence* of `.git`.\r\nfrom https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/33473 : \r\n\r\n>  I'm having trouble with deno/vtsls attaching to the same buffer. \r\n\r\nbut after some more thought, this is more like a problem with those insane configs. if they don't want to be enabled under specific conditions, those configs should figure out when they should / should not be enabled. \r\n\r\nafter all, `root_markers` is simply a way to *find the top-level directory*. whether a config enables itself is decided by `filetypes`, and/or `root()` in complex cases.\r\n\r\nfor even more insanity, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32287#issuecomment-2835155023 is a likely upcoming approach.\r\n\r\nthough ideally, \"merge\" would actually \"merge\" things instead of the current `tbl_deep_extend` behavior...",
