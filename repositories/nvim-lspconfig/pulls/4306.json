This allowed users to avoid manual annotations once the generated types were loaded. However, the current `vim.lsp.config` chooses to pass the server name as a positional argument rather than a key, so this method might not be effective—it might still work via `---@overload`, but I haven't tried that yet.\r\n\r\nI don't intend to deprecate `@type vim.lsp.Config`, but rather to provide compatibility. My current preliminary plan is to provide a series of separate `@class lspconfig.tsgo.settings`, so that manual annotation is at least possible.\r\n\r\n> * These custom types will be exposed, so they can also be used elsewhere (i.e., user's config)\r\n\r\nYes, this is a very important objective. In fact, neoconf itself doesn't need these type definitions; it generates them purely as a feature to make it convenient for users to use these types within their own configurations.\r\n\r\n",
