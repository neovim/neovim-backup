With this change the `root_dir` function now enforces, that the config file for eslint has to be in the same directory or below the found lock file. However it should be possible to use a config file that sits above the found lock files.\n\nIn my own setup I commented out the `stop` option of `vim.fs.find` in `root_dir` to make it work. Though that now leads to getting multiple eslint LSP instances in the same project. If I'm understanding this correctly the goal was to have only one. Shouldn't the server then use the directory of the config file as the root dir instead of the lock file?",

It's clearly something I did not think of and we could in fact check if there is a config file above the lock file even if it's a bit uncommon.\n\n> In my own setup I commented out the `stop` option of `vim.fs.find` in `root_dir` to make it work. Though that now leads to getting multiple eslint LSP instances in the same project. If I'm understanding this correctly the goal was to have only one. Shouldn't the server then use the directory of the config file as the root dir instead of the lock file?\n\nThe main issue with the ESLint LSP is that it will load only one version of ESLint per instance. This is why we \"group\" (with the root marker) by lock file, it's because it is recommended to use the same ESLint version accross your projects in a monorepo setup / you only have one in case of simple projects. So if you have multiple lock packages but only one config file, the ESLint versions could be different and in this case you should still have multiple instances.\n\nI am thinking that maybe we could try with only one instance per Nvim process (a bit like if no root marker was found) and try that out with multiple ESLint to see how it goes.",
