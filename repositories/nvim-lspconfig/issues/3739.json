[Lemminx repo / configuration settings](https://github.com/eclipse-lemminx/lemminx/blob/main/docs/Configuration.md#settings) shows `settings` as a child of `initializationOptions` in their sample, so I tried\n```lua\n require('lspconfig').lemminx.setup{\n    init_options = {\n        settings = {\n            xml = {\n                ...\n```\nand that worked.  `:LspLog` shows the settings and all my formatting, file associations, etc... work.  \n\nI wasn't sure if a PR would adhere to the contribution rules since the current config technically has everything to get the LSP \"running\".\n\n**Environment Info**\nWindows 10.0.19045\nNeovim 0.10.2\nLemminx binary (not jar)",
