I avoid running proprietary software anywhere I can, but with these configs I have no way of determining the license of a given language server, nor a way to disable proprietary ones like [Intelephense](https://intelephense.com). I would like to see a license field and a setting to enable only specific licenses or a class of licenses, like Gentoo's [ACCEPT_LICENSE](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf#ACCEPT_LICENSE) functionality.\n\nI could contribute toward this end if some direction was given. A store of licenses would have to be maintained somewhere, I wonder if something like this already exists in another project?",
