    "body": "### Description\n\nAs part of [this](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3876) PR the previously reported issue of `LspEslintFixAll` command being [async](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/3837#issuecomment-2901107052) was supposedly fixed. However, it seems this isn't the case. Following the on_attach method provided in the eslint documentation (of nvim-lspconfig) the lint fixes are made but then reverted during save. You can even undo to show the fixes that were applied before they were overwritten by the original file. Below is the relevant part of my config.\n\n```\nfor _, settings in pairs(servers) do\n    if settings.lsp == 'eslint' then\n        local base_on_attach = vim.lsp.config.eslint.on_attach\n        settings.config.on_attach = function(client, bufnr)\n            if not base_on_attach then return end\n\n            base_on_attach(client, bufnr)\n            vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('BufWritePre', {\n                buffer = bufnr,\n                command = 'LspEslintFixAll',\n            })\n        end\n        vim.lsp.config(settings.lsp, settings.config)\n        vim.lsp.enable(settings.lsp)\n    else\n        vim.lsp.config(settings.lsp, settings.config)\n        vim.lsp.enable(settings.lsp)\n    end\nend\n\n```",

I'm using Mason to get ESlint installed, but have confirmed the on_attach and settings are coming from lspconfig.\n\nPerhaps it's something else on my end. I tried using `LspEslintFixAll` manually and it has the intended effect. However, if I just save the file with `:w` it will briefly show the changes then revert to the original once the buffer is saved.\n\nIs there any other possible causes for this behaviour?\n\nEDIT: I just tested this in a dummy project and the behaviour works as expected on save. That's strange. The project in which I am having issues is a work project and we do use prettier to do formatting as well. Could this be a collision issue?\n\nSECOND EDIT: I spoke too soon earlier. I am not sure if my understanding of \"on save\" in the documentation is correct however, while `LspEslintFixAll` now runs on saves the edits it creates **are not** saved for me. Is this to be expected? If so, how can I configure it so that the edits created by `LspEslintFixAll` are included in the save instead of me having to perform a second save.",
