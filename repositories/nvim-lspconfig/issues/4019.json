Other language servers usually provide diagnostics as soon as a buffer is opened.\n\n### Reproduce the problem:\n1. Open a Unity C# project with Roslyn LSP configured through `nvim-lspconfig`.\n2. Add a new C# file → notice it is not recognized until running `:edit!`.\n3. Introduce a compile error in one file while another buffer is active.\n4. Switch to the buffer with the error → diagnostics are only shown after editing somehting the file.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\n- New files should be recognized without requiring `:edit!`.\n- Diagnostics should appear in a buffer as soon as it is opened, not only after editing.\n\n### Environment:\n- **OS:** Windows 10\n- **Neovim version: v0.11.3\n- **nvim-lspconfig version/commit: latest\n- **Roslyn LSP version:  latest\n\nI know Roslyn LSP itself currently does not implement file watching. I’m wondering if `nvim-lspconfig` could provide a workaround for this (similar to how some servers emulate file events).  \n\nFor the delayed diagnostics, I’m not sure whether this is a Roslyn limitation or something `lspconfig` could handle better. Guidance on whether this should be reported upstream to Roslyn would be greatly appreciated.\n",
