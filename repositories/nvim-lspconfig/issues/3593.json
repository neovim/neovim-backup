Ensure it is listed in `configs.md` or added as a custom server.\n```\n\n\nGiven I had last updated nvim-lspconfig less than a week ago, it seems likely that #3592  is the culprit somehow, though I don't see anything obvious in the diff that would cause it on first glance. Looks like the last explicitly angular-related PR before that was in 2022 though.\n",
