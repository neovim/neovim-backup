See https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/node/#first-class-package.json-support. However, after [this change,](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/commit/2d4ece4add76ea4fc3792e9425c62b3e66852d99) a Deno project set up this way will no longer have LSP support.\n\nReproduction script using lazy.nvim repro tools. This creates a typical LazyVim setup that has vtsls and denols enabled:\n\n```lua\nvim.env.LAZY_STDPATH = \".repro\"\nload(vim.fn.system(\"curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/folke/lazy.nvim/main/bootstrap.lua\"))()\n\nrequire(\"lazy.minit\").repro({\n  spec = {\n    { \"LazyVim/LazyVim\", import = \"lazyvim.plugins\" },\n    { \"LazyVim/LazyVim\", import = \"lazyvim.plugins.extras.lang.typescript\" },\n    {\n      \"neovim/nvim-lspconfig\",\n      commit = \"b34fbdf\",\n      opts = {\n        servers = {\n          -- as an example, this is also applicable for other non-Deno LSPs that technically work.\n          vtsls = {\n            enabled = true,\n          },\n          denols = {\n            enabled = true,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n\n```\nRunning this and trying to edit Typescript or Javascript in a repo with `package.json` and `deno.lock`, without a `deno.json`, will result in no LSPs being triggered.\n\nAn open question here to address this regression is which LSP *should* be activated in this situation?",

That's because later on in the plugin spec there's a `config` function that overwrites the default function that would have been called under normal circumstances. No `require(\"lspconfig\").setup()` is being called. Instead `mason-lspconfig` is being used to set up automatically the servers, which has transitioned to the new `vim.lsp.config`/`vim.lsp.enable` features. `nvim-lspconfig` is just used as a placeholder to load `mason-lspconfig` among other things.\n\nAccording to OP from the LazyVim [issue](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/issues/6816#issuecomment-3577293341)\n> I don't expect denols to get attached, per se. I expect vtsls to get attached, as that LSP was triggering before for my deno/node projects and worked perfectly fine.\n\nThe new branch from \n```lua\n\"AsPulse/nvim-lspconfig\",\nbranch = \"feat(lsp)/smarter-typescript-project-detection\",\n```\nseems to not solve this issue. `vtsls` should have been attached when opening `src/main.ts` file according to OP past comments, not `denols`. `commit = \"b34fbdf\"` correctly attaches `vtsls` server in that project when opening `src/main.ts` file. According to OP deno is only used as a package manager in that project\n>  such as a fresh Tauri project with deno selected as a package manager, and deno can function perfectly fine as the package manager without deno.json if there exists a package.json and a deno.lock\n\nand `vtsls` should be the LSP server attached in `src/main.ts` file.\n\nI don't know what the correct solution should be and I agree that `nvim-lspconfig` should only cover a general case and users should change `root_dir` according to their project's requirements. Maybe they could also use `:h exrc` for local project  configurations? \n\nPS: I don't know which LSP server should attach in this case, as I'm not familiar at all with Deno projects. If `vtsls` should attach, then I think the logic is still wrong (according to what OP said at least). If `denols` should attach in that Tauri project, then indeed a change is needed in LazyVim and then it will work properly (I tested with `branch = \"feat(lsp)/smarter-typescript-project-detection\"` and it works correctly if `denols` should attach). I just said about `vtsls` attaching because that is what OP mentioned himself and assumed that is what he wants, but I don't know what the correct answer is with regards to which LSP server should attach in a project like [VioletWoodETL/example-deno-tauri](https://github.com/VioletWoodETL/example-deno-tauri?rgh-link-date=2025-11-26T16%3A43%3A56.000Z).

Deno supports `package.json` and I'd leave it to the user to decide whether this lsp shall be activated. `package.json` is standard Deno nowadays and should definitely not be part of the list.\n\nHeuristics on detecting whether to run Deno can only go so far. My preference is to leave it to the user and we make the list of files configurable that prevents denols from being attached. For example, I'm having a hard time with the current configuration and a project that uses pnpm for storybook (currently not supported by Deno) and Deno for executing the application.",

It basically checks if the current file is whitelisted in `deno.enablePaths` and if so it sets `root_dir` to `nil` for `vtsls` (effectively ensuring only Deno LSP server is active for Deno files). Does the job but can probably be improved.\n\nThis means that the Deno LSP server _is_ actually attached to non-Deno TypeScript files, but since the server checks `deno.enablePaths` (and `deno.enable`) setting it won't do anything on files not matching those settings.\n\nIdeally I'd like `deno.enablePaths` to be respected here in lspconfig. \n\nCurrent approach of checking for `package.json`/`deno.json(c)`/`deno.lock` basically makes it impossible to mix Deno and non-Deno files within the same project (unless I'm missing something), so I've locked lspconfig to a specific commit.",

It might be a bit tedious, but `root_dir` and `on_attach` were fully customizable.\n\nTherefore, from my standpoint, what nvim-lspconfig should do is create \"better heuristics that cover as many common cases as possible.\" I think there will also be opposition to making heuristics more complex. Such things often make debugging difficult or confuse users with unintended behavior. How to handle these should be discussed, but whether we make the heuristics simple or complex, the behavior regarding LSP attachment is still completely up to the user. It's not just \"which LSP to attach to which files\" that's customizable, but \"the algorithm for determining which LSP to attach to which files,\" which is very Neovim-like behavior, and I believe that's already achieved.\n\nIn other words, referring to lsp's `deno.enablePaths` for determining isn't adding any new customizability; it's just an improvement to the heuristics. It's not a silver bullet, and like previous changes, it will cause unintended results for some people. I don't think this can be justified solely on the grounds that \"heuristic can't detect everything, so leave it to user\".\n\n---\n\nUltimately, explicity is necessary to escape heuristics.\nThis means providing options for the issues discussed so far, such as \"how to handle the coexistence of package.json and deno.lock\" and \"how to handle deno.enablePaths.\"\n\nHowever, I don't think this falls within the scope of nvim-lspconfig.\n\nLooking at the series of discussions, I think the most organized solution would be to prepare a separate plugin that allows setting convenient options as mentioned above, and provides `on_attach` and `root_dir`. (I will try to create it if I have time.)\n\n",
