    "body": "### Description\n\nThe recommended way to install neovim is via the package manager on the official site. Debian (and Ubuntu LTS) currently installs an older version so we get a warning message. I'm reporting this here since nvim-lspconfig is under the same org and maintained by the same people. Hopefully this shouldn't be an alignment issue with different projects being done by different developers that have a different viewpoint on what is the correct behaviour. Hopefully this is just an oversight. One way to remediate could be to change the recommended installation method in the docs, the point of this ticket is just that it should be consistent.",
