    "body": "### Description\n\nWhen working in a project which uses Yarn2 (also known as PnP or Plug and Play) and then opening a for example a `.js` file, the ESLint LSP tries to start but can't, printing this warning:\n```\n[lspconfig] Unable to find ESLint library.\n```\n\nWhen using Yarn2, the eslint executable is not `node_modules` but instead in `.yarn/sdks`. \n\nThis can be fixed by hardcoding the following setting:\n```lua\nvim.lsp.config('eslint', {\n  settings = { nodePath = '.yarn/sdks' },\n})\n```\n\nThat is an okay solution, but not good if working in a multiple projects where some use Yarn2 and some use npm. It would be great if the config could detect if Yarn2 or something else is used and set the `nodePath` according to that.\n\nWhen looking in the [eslint.lua](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/943a0556638fb809d3f72f1f091454bd56b23021/lsp/eslint.lua#L151) in this repo, it seems there is a solution for that, but it's not working (at least not for me). \n\nI tried the following but that did not work either.\n```lua    \nvim.lsp.config('eslint', {\n  settings = { nodePath = 'node_modules' },\n  before_init = function(_params, config)\n    local yarn_lib = vim.fs.find('.yarn/sdks/eslint', { path = config.root_dir, upward = true })[1]\n    if yarn_lib then\n      config.settings.nodePath = '.yarn/sdks'\n    end\n  end\n})\n```\n\nDoes anyone have an idea on another solution for this? Could this be done?",
