It would be great if the config could detect if Yarn2 or something else is used and set the `nodePath` according to that.\n\nWhen looking in the [eslint.lua](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/943a0556638fb809d3f72f1f091454bd56b23021/lsp/eslint.lua#L151) in this repo, it seems there is a solution for that, but it's not working (at least not for me). \n\nI tried the following but that did not work either.\n```lua    \nvim.lsp.config('eslint', {\n  settings = { nodePath = 'node_modules' },\n  before_init = function(_params, config)\n    local yarn_lib = vim.fs.find('.yarn/sdks/eslint', { path = config.root_dir, upward = true })[1]\n    if yarn_lib then\n      config.settings.nodePath = '.yarn/sdks'\n    end\n  end\n})\n```\n\nDoes anyone have an idea on another solution for this? Could this be done?",
