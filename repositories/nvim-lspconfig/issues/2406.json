    "body": "### Description\n\nI recently finished configuring my neovim environment, mainly for working with python/c/cpp projects, I even managed to configure a dap setup which \"kind of\" works I guess. My problem is when it comes to syntax highlighting/general usage of the lsp client for cmake, nothing seems to work even though I configured it exactly the same way as other lsps I'm currently using.\r\n\r\nI created a project with multiple folders including a .git and build folders, which should be triggered as the root dir so the lsp should be attached to the CMakelists.txt file or Makefile file, or at least that's what I understood in the https://github.com/regen100/cmake-language-server description.\r\n\r\nMy lsp configuration is the same as this one: https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/master/lua/user/lsp/mason.lua adding to the servers the cmake one. I can provide some more screenshots showing other lsp clients working fine out of the box with their buffers but the cmake being active and not attaching to any cmake file I create.\r\n\r\nDo you guys have any idea why am I having this issue? Needless to say I'm a total beginner when it comes to vim/neovim stuff, and I recently managed to put together kind of a semi-decent configuration copying plenty of the options Chris and other delevopers from lunarvim shared in their repos.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to read my question, this might be a duplicate but I've been aimlessly searching trying to find someone with a similar issue than mine with no results.\r\n\r\nI tried creating multiple cmake and make style files. Plus adding more folders so that the root directory would be detected and the lsp client could be attached to the buffer successfully.\n\n### Neovim version\n\nNVIM v0.8.1\r\nBuild type: Release\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3\r\n\n\n### Nvim-lspconfig version\n\n a59ba78f164f586d47a2f315dc3d021a630768d0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22.04.1 LTS \n\n### Affected language servers\n\ncmake\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create  sample project directory structure including a .git, src, include, libs, build and bin folders.\r\n2. Add a Makefile in the project's root and a CMakelists.txt\r\n3. Open either one of these files in a buffer with nvim\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe cmake client is not attached to any of the buffers even though the on attach premise condition has theoretically been met\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80027196/213144370-ec0f19b5-d974-499d-a75d-3b9dcd211d48.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe client should be attached to the buffer providing auto-completion and other features from lsps\n\n### Minimal config\n\n```Lua\nMy configuration is mostly the same as this github repo provided by the Chris colleagues from Lunarvim, with the exception of the cmake server being added into the servers list, plus installing it using the Mason plugin.\r\nhttps://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/blob/master/lua/user/lsp/mason.lua\n```\n\n\n### LSP log\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/josedev9/57f0eb2bc35ce681035cb529f2de62ab#file-lsp-log",
