The Nextflow server was developed with VSCode in mind, but I do not see why it wouldn't work with Neovim.\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/31899\n\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\n\n<sup>Originally posted by **Gullumluvl** January  7, 2025</sup>\nNextflow language server configuration was [recently added to nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3423).\n\nI have spent days trying to figure out a minimal working setup, but it still isn't functional, so this is why I am asking someone who knows!\n\nBriefly, I recently switched from Vim to Neovim. I only have Vim plugins from my old configuration.\n\n**Problem:** I manage to get the `nexflow_ls` server show up in `LspInfo`, but LSP functions (typed as lua commands) do not produce any effect.\n\n**Steps:** Here is what I did to set up:\n\n1. clone [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) into `~/.config/nvim/pack/nvim/start`.\n\n2. Get the jar file [`nextflow-language-server-all.jar`](https://github.com/nextflow-io/language-server/releases)\n\n3. Modify the `cmd` from the `nextflow_ls` setup call to use the downloaded jar.\n\n4. Open a nextflow file from my project. The project directory contains a `nextflow.config` and a `.git` folder, so I expect the project root to be identified.\n\n5. I execute `:lua =require'lspconfig'.nextflow_ls.setup{}`\n\n6. I execute `:LspStart`\n    At this point, _nothing_ appears to change in the editor. However the server command is running on my system.\n\n7. I execute `:LspInfo`\n    which shows that the client `nextflow_ls` is attached to the buffer.\n\n8. I type `:lua =vim.lsp.buf.document_highlight()`\n   which says that it's not supported by any of the attached language servers.\n\n    I also tried `:lua =vim.lsp.buf.hover()` with the cursor on a process name.\n   which says \"no information available\"\n\n   I tried `:lua =vim.lsp.buf.definition()`\n  which does nothing.\n\n   I tried a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>]</kbd> shortcut which errored with \"No marker file\", \"Tag not found:\".\n\nI believe these capabilities are supported by the language server.\n\nWhat am I missing? It's hard to know what, because the commands that start the server never complain, even when the server doesn't start. Is there a way to have more verbose outputs from the server? \n\nThanks a lot for your help!</div>",
