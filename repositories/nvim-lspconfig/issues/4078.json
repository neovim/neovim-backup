Unzip [repro.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21826457/repro.zip) or clone from https://github.com/gmzacharydovel/eslint-nvim-repro\n2. Install Deno from https://deno.com/\n3. Run `deno install` from the `package` subdirectory to install the dependencies and then use `nvim` to open `src/index.ts`.\n4. Notice that there are errors but still shows the eslint messages with a `vim/0.11.3/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/_transport.lua` error.\n5. Run `deno install` from the `project` subdirectory to install the dependencies and then use nvim to open the local src/index.ts\n6. Notice that it also shows the `vim/0.11.3/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/_transport.lua` but does not show any eslint messages.\n\nCommands only  version\n```sh\ncurl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh\ngit clone https://github.com/gmzacharydovel/eslint-nvim-repro\ncd eslint-nvim-repro/package\ndeno install\nnvim src/index.ts\n\ncd ../package\ndeno install\nnvim src/index.ts\n```\n\n### EXPECTED:\nIt should show the eslint mesages without the transport.lua error.\n\n### ACTUAL:\nFor the `project` subfolder, there are no eslint messages at all.  For the `package` subfolder, the transport error happens but still shows the eslint messages.  Running eslint manually works fine with this output:\n\n```sh\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint src/index.ts\n\neslint-repro/package/src/index.ts\n  3:8  error  Parsing error: ';' expected\n\nâœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\n```\n\n### SIDE NOTES:\n\n1. Deno installs the eslint executable into .bin of the project directory. But indirect dependencies are installed into `node_modules/.deno/*`.  This may be related to why the nvim lsp doesn't find eslint even though the `.bin` file is in the same place.\n\n2. If you use npm to install the dependencies, everything work correctly for both the package and project sub directories.\n\n3. I would not be surprised if this effects other package managers as well.  Like yarn or pnpm.",

Yet you have reported this in nvim-lspconfig, which is a repo for LSP configs. \n\nAssuming you are using https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lsp/eslint.lua , then that config has documentation (read it) which mentions a URL(s) to places that may be more relevant.\n\nIf you reported this here because you thought this was the place to report \"Nvim LSP\" issues, then you clearly didn't read the README.md in this repo, nor the issue template.\n\nThe fact tha `lua/vim/lsp/_transport.lua` appears in a stracktrace doesn't mean there is a bug in Nvim.\n\nI'm sorry you are having trouble, but this repo (and the Neovim core repo) are not a place that exist to provide troubleshooting for platform issues. I don't use eslint LS, and there are about 1000 configs here so we can't possilby provide support for all of them. It's up to you to debug your own environment. This is mentioned in multiple places in the docs here.\n",
