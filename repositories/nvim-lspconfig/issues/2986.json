So while it actually got activated the issue is configuration because the >>library<< doesn't know the project using it. I could work around by adding a psalm.xml config file and choosing one of the many. But doesn't feel like a true fix. Actually using git submodule or such would be good enough for development. But having to checkout code 40 times cause there are 40+ projects using it feels more hackish.",
