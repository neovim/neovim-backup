However, 0 are configured: []\n```\n\nThis happens launching the language server manually, too (`srb tc --lsp` not in project root).\n\nTo fix it, `cmd_cwd` can be set, for example like this:\n\n```lua\nvim.lsp.config('sorbet', {\n  cmd_cwd = vim.fs.root(0, 'Gemfile')\n})\n```\n\nThough I am not sure why this is needed, since it should be set automatically to the `root_dir` if I am correct (which should be found by `root_markers`?):\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/61e5109c8cf24807e4ae29813a3a82b31821dd45/lua/lspconfig/manager.lua#L118-L120\n\nAnd I don't see any other ls config make use of `cmd_cwd` (can't imagine sorbet is the only ls with this requirement, or is it?).\n\nSo is `cmd_cwd` needed here?

            "body": "@justinmk There is similar issue with `ast_grep`: it either should be run inside project dir (which won't happens when we run nvim in one project's dir and later open a file from another project) or get extra `--config /another/project/sgconfig.yml` args.\n\nHow this can be fixed? This won't work (probably because it's too late and `cmd` is already executed):\n```lua\n        before_init = function(_, config)\n            config.cmd_cwd = config.root_dir\n        end,\n```\n\nI've also tried to modify `cmd_cwd` on `BufEnter` but it looks like this has no effect. Probably original `cwd_cwd` is cached/copied somewhere and later calls to `vim.lsp.config()` has no effect. Here is what I tried:\n\n```lua\n            vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('BufEnter', {\n                group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup('user.lsp.bufenter', { clear = true }),\n                pattern = '*',\n                callback = function(ev)\n                    vim.lsp.config(\n                        'ast_grep',\n                        { cmd_cwd = vim.fs.dirname(vim.fs.abspath(ev.file)) }\n                    )\n                end,\n            })\n```\n\nI've even tried to `:lcd` on `BufEnter` - does not work either. `:pwd` shows `:lcd` works okay, but `ast-grep` still executes in directory where `nvim` was started.",
