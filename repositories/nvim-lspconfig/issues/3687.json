This new tab is what I mean't, sorry for the confusion. You helped me pinpoint what's up regardless. Cheers!\n\nJust in case you're interested in some reason. Setting the 'mode' option for the plugin mentioned to \"tabs\", seems to fix the issue I was having, but not completely. I've opened up an issue on the plugin's repo. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.\n\nThanks again for chipping in.",
