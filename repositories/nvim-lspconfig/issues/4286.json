    "body": "### Description\n\nI added an `eslint.lua` file in my `after/lsp` directory and I copied the code inside this repos `eslint.lua` to setup running `LspEslintFixAll` on save. I used the `base_on_attach` and called it first just like the code example and this killed LSP functionality as I ended up in an infinite loop as my new `on_attach` overwrote the one in this repo as it seems the `after/lsp` code is loaded over and over.\n\nI'm not sure if this is considered a bug but to me as an end user it's a poor experience. I'm not really sure how to deal with this issue other than continuing to provide the old style exports from this repo or expecting users to just copy the code into their config or not use `after/lsp`.",
