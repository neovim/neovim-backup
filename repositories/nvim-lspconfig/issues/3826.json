It has been over 2 years since the current tooling has completely replaced the old one and today **Volar** is not really used anymore in regards to Vue's language tooling, because it refers to the [underlying JS library](https://volarjs.dev/) instead.\n\nWith that in mind I propose two changes:\n1. Rename `volar` within nvim-lspconfig\n    - The npm package goes by `@vue/language-server` and the executable by `vue-language-server`, so in accordance with the contributing guidelines `vue_ls` would probably make the most sense\n2. Remove `vuels` from nvim-lspconfig\n    - it is no longer actively maintained\n    - it creates confusion (see #3823)\n\nI'm open to create the PR, but since these are breaking changes, I wanted to discuss them first.",
