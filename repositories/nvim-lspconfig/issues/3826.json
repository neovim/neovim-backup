    "body": "### Description\n\nWhen [Vue's current language tooling](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools) was new it used **Volar** to differentiate it from the old language tools (**[Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur)**). It has been over 2 years since the current tooling has completely replaced the old one and today **Volar** is not really used anymore in regards to Vue's language tooling, because it refers to the [underlying JS library](https://volarjs.dev/) instead.\n\nWith that in mind I propose two changes:\n1. Rename `volar` within nvim-lspconfig\n    - The npm package goes by `@vue/language-server` and the executable by `vue-language-server`, so in accordance with the contributing guidelines `vue_ls` would probably make the most sense\n2. Remove `vuels` from nvim-lspconfig\n    - it is no longer actively maintained\n    - it creates confusion (see #3823)\n\nI'm open to create the PR, but since these are breaking changes, I wanted to discuss them first.",

            "body": "@nick22985 When I made this proposal I was thinking about the potential Vue2 usecase, but came to the conclusion that keeping `vuels` for that isn't really necessary for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, Vue2 is EOL for more than a year now. But that alone isn't a good enough reason, because obviously that does not stop projects from using it (as https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-vue shows).\n\nSecond, and more importantly, since Neovim 0.11 it is much easier to setup LSPs without the need of nvim-lsp. Just add the old [`vuels.lua`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/61e5109c8cf24807e4ae29813a3a82b31821dd45/lsp/vuels.lua) file into your config (under `<rtp>/lsp/`) or set it via `vim.lsp.config`.\n\nBecause of that and the potential confusion for newcomers (it was #3823 that prompted me to open this issue) I don't think it's super worth it to keep the config in nvim-lsp.\n\nBut it in the end the decision is with others. If there is indeed enough need to bring it back, I would recommend naming it `vetur` instead of `vuels`, to differentiate it clearly from `vue_ls`.",
