The language server is either not installed, missing from PATH, or not executable.\n\n```\n\n## investigation\n\nthe \"cmd\" config in lspconfig was \"nil\" and it was needed to proceed to the lsp launch.\n\n## solution:\n\nI tested 2 solutions that was working:\n\n - either (in my config) add a cmd in my \"config\" with \"OmniSharp\" in:\n ```lua\nlspconfig[\"omnisharp\"].setup(config)\n ```\n\n - or (in lspconfig) add:\n ``` lua\n return {\n   default_config = {\n       cmd = { 'OmniSharp' },\n           settings = {\n                 FormattingOptions = {\n                 ...\n ```\n in \n ``` bash\n~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-lspconfig/lua/lspconfig/configs/omnisharp.lua\n ```\nI feel like the second option is the intended default way so i created this issue.\n\nas i am writing this, i see that there is 2 config files for omnisharp, one in lsp/omnisharp.lua and the other in lua/lspconfig/configs/omnisharp.lua. The first one seems to have a complete configuration but not the second. I don't know what the 2 confs are for so I don't know if there is a problem with my setup.\n\n",
