There are errors being reported that shouldnt be with new versions of angular. It looks as though some backwards compatibility options recently added may be effecting newer projects.\n\n## Bug\nAngular 19+ components are default standalone, but with the new nvim-lspconfig updates these error show for new projects when they shouldnt.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ae25866-0b33-4d0f-bc79-87d89afb7a70)\n\n## Reproduce\n1. Install latest `nvim-lspconfig`\n2. Install `angularls`(i use mason-lspconfig)\n3. Start new angular 19+ project, `ng new`\n4. Install `npm install --save-dev @angular/language-service` (needed for lsp to work in project)\n5. See errors like above screen shot in components with imports that are defaulte standalone\n\nThe incorrect errors from the lsp stop if I pin `nvim-lspconfig` to commit ` commit = \"1f941b3\"` in my lazy config. (This is the commit before the angular prs).\n\nIm on linux/popos\n\n## Related PRs/commits\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3592\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/commit/9962e25a23f0e992116b99a9a6400947d5a7177b <-- This seems to be the culprit as pinning any commits after result in the errors described",

I would like to track it\n\nThere are some new issues regarding the version migration, but the ones I followed are all closed:\n\n- https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/2104\n- https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/2119\n- https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/2123\n\nLooking back at it, it feels like we should've let users handle this by enforcing `standalone: false` if using older versions of Angular with a newer version of the language server.",
