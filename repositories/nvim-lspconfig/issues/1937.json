    "body": "We currently have API which allows to set language server specific commands. Example from clangd:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/c5dae15c0c94703a0565e8ba35a9f5cb96ca7b8a/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/clangd.lua#L52-L59\r\n\r\nBut @justinmk [suggested](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1921#issuecomment-1143705517) to remove them.\r\nI personally find them useful, especially `ClangdSwitchSourceHeader`. I don't think it's good for users to copy them from other people's configs. And having a separate plugin for a few lines of code for `ClangdSwitchSourceHeader` is also weird. So I think having them here is the right place.\r\n\r\nSo it's more like a feature keep request :)",

In general, if a server requires custom client-side commands or off-spec handlers, then the server configuration should be added without those in lspconfig and receive a dedicated plugin such as nvim-jdtls, nvim-metals, etc.\r\n\r\nBut the example given later in CONTRIBUTING.md mentions `PyrightOrganizeImports` ... 😕 ",

This issue is about Neovim commands specific to a server. For example, [rust_analyzer](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#rust_analyzer) (see below in `Commands` section) have `CargoReload`.\r\nAnd users can define their own commands, for example [here is my config](https://github.com/Shatur/neovim-config/blob/ae8a7ef914d7a1d4ffa36be33aeee8b593930e43/plugin/lsp.lua#L129-L142). But this feature was proposed for removal and I decided to open an issue to ask developers to keep it.",

I've been trying to look at these codes recently. Check out the roadmap with `lspconfig` and some justin's comments. I thought I could explain a little bit about the purpose of this project.  Please correct me if I am wrong @justinmk. I will hide or delete this comment. so as not to confuse others about this project.\r\n\r\nlspconfig provides basic settings for all servers. And do some actions around the lsp service such as `start` `shutdown` etc . Why does this project exist. Consider not all users have knowledge of lsp and server settings. We create this project. It is convenient for any neovimer to simply enable the language server. But please note that `lspconfig` should only provide the most basic settings. Now some people understand that if you want to use neovim's lsp, you must use `lspconfig`. Do not. Anyone can make any language server plugin around neovim's lsp api. We would prefer to see some neovim lsp plugins in the future that will focus on setting up one or more language servers. In-depth development to adapt to more users of the language. like `nvim-jtdls` or some other plugins. maybe in future you will see like `nvim-gopls` `nvim-tsserver` such as plugin that do most work in server config. Currently the project is bloated. You can see that a large number of language server configurations exist. Maybe you may only use a few of these servers. So that's why you see some commands or something getting deleted. Because we cannot guarantee that it will be needed by all users of that language (personal opinion) .  But based on some api of `lspconfig` you can fully implement it on your personal configuration.   \r\n\r\nAt present our main work is to promote the progress of lsp on the neovim core. Development of some features. Currently known backward features such as inlay hint smantictoken are not implemented yet. These will have higher priority. \r\n\r\ncc @bennypowers  #2089 also do same thing , explain in there.\r\n  \r\n",

It isn't for user-interactive usage.\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28329#issuecomment-2782749254\n\nWe have now implemented:\n\n- Guidance for nvim-lspconfig:\n    - CI lint check enforces: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3754\n        - Config-defined commands must be buffer-local.\n        - Config-defined commands must started with `Lsp` prefix.\n        - Use `client:exec_cmd()` https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3755\n    - CONTRIBUTING.md mentions:\n        - Do not create commands that just alias to code-actions or code-lenses. Those are already discoverable via `gra` (or `vim.lsp.buf.code_action()`).",
