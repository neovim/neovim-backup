Snippets do not expand and applying the following code to init.lua: \n```\nlocal capabilities = {\n    textDocument = {\n        completion = {\n            completionItem = {\n                snippetSupport = false,\n            },\n        },\n    },\n}\n\nvim.lsp.config(\"rust_analyzer\", {capabilities = capabilities})\nvim.lsp.enable(\"rust_analyzer\")\n```\n\nAppears to resolve the problem. Additionally, supplying `vim.lsp.config()` with the result of `vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()` appears to make no difference. Taking this table and applying the above fix to it resolves the issue as expected. I have confirmed using `:checkhealth: vim.lsp` to ensure that both rust-analyzer has been started and the expected tables for capabilities (either `make_client_capabilities` from vim.lsp.protocol or whatever the result is from the default config) have been applied correctly at the time of running the above screenshots.
