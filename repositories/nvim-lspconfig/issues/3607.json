The problem is that anything I put on `on_attach` doesn't seem to work.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n``` lua\nlspconfig[\"prismals\"].setup({\n  on_attach = function(client, bufnr)\n    print(\"Prisma Language Server started\")\n  end\n})\n\n```\n\nThis should print when I open a `.prisma` file, but nothing happens. When I run `:LspInfo` I can see `prismals` running correctly, but it is not executing the `on_attach` function. \nAm I missing something, or could this be a bug?",
