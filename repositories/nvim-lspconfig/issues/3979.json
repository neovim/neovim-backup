This is the case when you integrate tailwind through a CDN like `<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4\"></script>`.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n1. Use `.git` as a fallback similar to how it is done in other lsp configs\n2. ~~Add the buffer filename itself to the `root_markers_with_field()` search and/or~~ \n3. properly document this limitation so that users can create a placeholder `tailwind.config.js` as a workaround\n\nIt took me quite some time to understand why the LSP is not attached, after checking file types and debugging my LSP config. So to save others some time, I suggest to fix this.\n\n[^1]: https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#css-first-configuration",
