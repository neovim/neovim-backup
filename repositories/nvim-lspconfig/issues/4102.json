    "body": "### Description\n\nWhen in multi-module maven project the structure looks like this:\n\n```\nmodule-a/pom.xml\nmodule-b/pom.xml\npom.xml\n```\n\nwhere pom.xml is parent that includes all submodules. With the default rooter config using pom.xml and navigating to module-a it will only start the lsp in module-a workdir, which usually breaks in multi-module projects that depend on eachother (example is impl depending on dto with parent including both)\n\nThere is no easy solution to this as its hard to distinguish between child and parent pom.xml.\n\nOne solution is to just have .git in rooter config as well, but this was recently removed because of nested java projects, but this use-case is arguably *way less* common than multimodule maven project starting from root git dir, so at minimum this should be reverted (and it do not even breaks jdtls if for example cwd is root dir and the java project is in lets say my-project/pom.xml etc, so i am not sure why it was even removed in first place).\n\nAnother improvement is to add mvnw to root files, its similar to gradlew but used less commonly (but projects do use it sometimes).",
