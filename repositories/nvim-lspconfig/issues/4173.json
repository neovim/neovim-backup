As a neovim plugin, I think the slight naming inaccuracy is probably worth keeping the command names consistent.\n\nHowever, when these commands are eventually upstreamed, I think it would be correct to rename them at that point, since it would mean the command vocabulary pairs nicely with existing documentation and function names. I wanted to make that change here so it wouldn't be forgotten (as this repo serves as a testbed before being upstreamed), but making it during the upstreaming process would also work, as long as its clear that `:LspStop` should become `:lsp disable`.",
