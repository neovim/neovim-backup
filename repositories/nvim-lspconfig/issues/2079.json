To be clear:\r\n\r\n- we don't need to remove anything on `util`, its interface can stay frozen for back-compat.\r\n- *internally*, the implementation of `util` should *shrink* as we update it to use stdlib features of the minimum-supported Nvim version.\r\n- as we bump the minimum required Nvim, we will add lint rules to the lspconfig CI which prevent configs from using `util` functions if the minimum supported Nvim (currently 0.9) has alternatives.\r\n\r\nFor example, `search_ancestors` currently doesn't use `vim.fs.parents` even though it has been available since Nvim 0.8 https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/39f31e178466e4ed23c8ea6fddd5b7a4d9699398/lua/lspconfig/util.lua#L248",

Because we'll just freeze it once everything is upstreamed. And meanwhile, shrinking the actual implementation gives us a clear picture of which logic still doesn't have an upstream equivalent. The mere presence of `util.dirname` doesn't harm anything, though, yes, we will need to update something like `.github/ci/run_sanitizer.sh` to prevent future uses of `util.dirname` in configs.\n\nAs we hollow-out the guts of `util`, it will become almost empty. We can later decide whether we want to delete it entirely, and that can be done as one big \"breaking\" step instead of many incremental \"breaking\" steps.",
