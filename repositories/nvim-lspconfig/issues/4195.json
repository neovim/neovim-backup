And the LSP log also remains empty. When I run `:LspRestart`, I get an error: \n\n```\ndocker_language_server: -32600: server not initialized\n```\n\nIn comparison, when using older dockerfile-language-server (`dockerls` in nvim-lspconfig), there's no such problem.\n\nRelevant parts of `:LspInfo`:\n\n```\nvim.lsp: Active Clients ~\n- docker_language_server (id: 2)\n  - Version: v0.20.1\n  - Root directory: ~/test\n  - Command: { \"docker-language-server\", \"start\", \"--stdio\" }\n  - Settings: {}\n  - Attached buffers: 5\n\n- docker_language_server:\n  - capabilities: {\n      textDocument = {\n        completion = {\n          completionItem = {\n            commitCharactersSupport = false,\n            deprecatedSupport = true,\n            documentationFormat = { \"markdown\", \"plaintext\" },\n            insertReplaceSupport = true,\n            insertTextModeSupport = {\n              valueSet = { 1 }\n            },\n            labelDetailsSupport = true,\n            preselectSupport = false,\n            resolveSupport = {\n              properties = { \"documentation\", \"detail\", \"additionalTextEdits\", \"command\", \"data\" }\n            },\n            snippetSupport = true,\n            tagSupport = {\n              valueSet = { 1 }\n            }\n          },\n          completionList = {\n            itemDefaults = { \"commitCharacters\", \"editRange\", \"insertTextFormat\", \"insertTextMode\", \"data\" }\n          },\n          contextSupport = true,\n          insertTextMode = 1\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  - cmd: { \"docker-language-server\", \"start\", \"--stdio\" }\n  - filetypes: dockerfile, yaml.docker-compose\n  - get_language_id: <function @/Users/user/.local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-lspconfig/lsp/docker_language_server.lua:14>\n  - root_markers: { \"Dockerfile\", \"docker-compose.yaml\", \"docker-compose.yml\", \"compose.yaml\", \"compose.yml\", \"docker-bake.json\", \"docker-bake.hcl\", \"docker-bake.override.json\", \"docker-bake.override.hcl\" }\n```\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- MacOS\n- neovim v0.11.5",
