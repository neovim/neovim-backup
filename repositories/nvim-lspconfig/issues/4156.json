I'm receiving this error when using the provided autocmd in the copilot.lua file. \n\nI did some debugging and the documentation and file mention \"vim.lsp.inline_completion.enable()\" and \":help lsp-inline-completion,\" respectively. It seems that these do not exist.\n\nMy structure is as follows. Note, this uses Lazy and its required structure.\ninit.lua\nlsp/\nlua/\n-- lua/config/lsp (here is where I vim.lsp.enable() everything)\n\nI am unsure if the issue is something with my configuration; that doesn't seem likely since the above two do not exist, but maybe I'm wrong here.\n\nThis may be an issue with vim.lsp and if so, happy to close this and make it there. \n\nIf there's any other information you all need me to provide, please let me know.",
