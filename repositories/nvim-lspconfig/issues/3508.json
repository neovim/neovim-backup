The issue occurs with the following directory structure:\n\n```sh\nHOME/\n├─ workspaces/ # `root`, actual `root_dir`\n│  ├─ stylua.toml # one of `root_files`\n│  ├─ lua/\n│  ├─ python/\n│  ├─ work/\n│  │  ├─ SomeProjectWithLuaFiles/ # `root_git`, expected `root_dir`\n│  │  │  ├─ .git/\n```\n\nWhenever I open a file under `../SomeProjectWithLuaFiles/`, I expect `root_dir` is set to `../SomeProjectWithLuaFiles/`. However somehow `root_dir` is set to `HOME/workspaces/`. After quick investigation, it seems `stylua.toml` makes the LSP set `root_dir` to `HOME/workspaces/` because after I removed `stylua.toml` the `root_dir` is now `../SomeProjectWithLuaFiles/`. Looking at `lua_ls` config, it seems this is caused by early return from the following lines:\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/3cb6c05779459eb5fe9cddbb47675593594f0415/lua/lspconfig/configs/lua_ls.lua#L19-L21\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3322 suggest setting `root_dir` to the longer root path if both a `.git`- and a `lua`-ancestor are found, which is not satisfied in this case.\n\nPlease let me know if this is confirmed to be an issue. I am happy to help with a PR.\n",

[…]\n\nI completely agree with @mangkoran here. From my experience with Lua, I would also expect that the LSP simply takes the longest among **all** candidate paths as root dir. So I think the suggested change makes sense for the Lua LSP.\n\nAnd similarly, while I personally think it's probably a very good approximation for almost all LSPs to use the longest path as root dir if there are multiple candidates (due to different types of indicator files), I could imagine that\n* maybe there are some languages where this is not intended and\n* even if not, making this the default for all LSPs will likely break some people's configs.\n \nSo not sure whether the (maybe) better default behavior is worth the potential problems it might cause to change this for all LSPs.",
