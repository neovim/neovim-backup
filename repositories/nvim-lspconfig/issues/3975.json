    "body": "### Description\n\nFor Nvim 0.11.2 and later, `:LspRestart` and `:LspStop` require the server name to be available in `vim.lsp.config` table (which means it must be configured in new 0.11 way). However the completion both commands provide also include servers that were started with `vim.lsp.start()` or `vim.lsp.start_client()`. And if I provide no server names to `:LspRestart/:LspStop`, both commands will also attempt to stop those invalid servers, which leads to error.\n\nTo reproduce, just install this plugin and [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim). After that, try running `:LspRestart` (with no arguments)",
