Can information such as tool versions be derived from LSP client info and/or server responses instead?\n\nExample use case: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1693 which wants to report the \"project file\".\n\n### Proposal\n\n- ✅ print the `<cmd> --version` result. [3375](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3375),  [3383](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3383) [3388](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3388)\n- ✅  LSP spec has `serverInfo.version` https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31611\n- capabilities hints:\n    - does the server have document formatting support?\n- The client has `workspace/configuration`, so it knows its own configuration. Why can't LspInfo ask the cient for this kind of info? \n- The client can ask the server for `workspace/workspaceFolders`, which sounds related to \n- the Nvim client can store info from `initialize`, `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`, etc. If that info is available via e.g. `vim.lsp.get_clients()`, then LspInfo can use it. If info *isn't* available via `vim.lsp.get_clients()`, then question is why, and should it be?\n\n\nsuggested by @glacambre : \n\n> Could a new field be added to language server configurations listing additional [workspace/executeCommand](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_executeCommand) requests that would be nice to perform on `:LspInfo`? Then the als' configuration could have [`als-project-file`](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/blob/60d5298980b93f7b5d4d2c97df4236c55b4361ff/integration/vscode/ada/src/ExtensionState.ts#L191) in that field, and Neovim could display the result of that request as a string in LspInfo's buffer.\n\nMaybe `vim.lsp.Client` could have a `statusCmds: string[]` field which defines how \"status\" can be reported by a server.",

Does `workspace/workspaceFolders` report anything useful? \n\nAnd why isn't `root_dir` enough to provide what was intended in https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1693 @TamaMcGlinn  ? `root_dir` already defines the `*.gpr` pattern, so why can't checkhealth use `root_dir` to say which pattern matched, then report that?",

In such a case, clients will often use `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` to select a `.gpr` file, but storing and re-displaying that information would not work in cases where the client let the server choose a `.gpr` file.",
