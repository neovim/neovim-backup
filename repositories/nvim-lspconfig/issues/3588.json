Apologies if this is not the correct forum, I could not see a discussions tab.\n\nThank you!",

Although by now most people may have already migrated, so renaming it again might be worse...\n- We should avoid breaking changes to `lspconfig.util`; instead, we want to ensure that it is 100% NOT needed for Nvim 0.11.\n    - We are in the process of soft-deprecating the entire `lspconfig.util` module.\n- Years from now, when the minimum Nvim required for nvim-lspconfig is eventually increased to Nvim 0.11, then we can drop `lspconfig.util`.\n- Configs maintained in THIS repo must not use any part of `lspconfig.util`.",
