    "body": "# Description\n\nWith `vim.lsp.config` https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31031 , Nvim 0.11+ now has an interface for defining LSP configs. Previously, the config format was defined by nvim-lspconfig (this repo) and did not have core Nvim support.\n\n# Migration plan\n\n## Phase 1: Nvim 0.11 users can use these configs via `vim.lsp.config`\n\n1. Create `lsp/*.lua` configs (in this repo) that simply wrap the existing `lua/lspconfig/configs/*.lua` configs.\n    - Ignore `root_dir`? Copy-paste filenames into `root_markers`?\n2. Upstream relevant parts of the [healthcheck](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/health.lua).\n    - On Nvim 0.11 `lspconfig/health.lua` should do nothing (or error). On Nvim 0.10 it will continue to work.\n3. Nvim 0.11+ can use nvim-lspconfigs like this:\n   ```lua\n   vim.lsp.config('foo')\n   ```\n3. Nvim 0.11+ users no longer need to (directly) call `require('lspconfig')` for any reason.\n\n## Phase 2: migrate the actual config code\n\n1. Tag a `v1.x` release.\n2. ~~BREAKING: The `master` branch will require Nvim 0.11 and will throw an error if `vim.lsp.config` is not found (and point the user to the v1.x branch).~~\n3. Keep the old configs on master, but document that they are frozen and won't be supported.\n4. If Nvim 0.10 or older is detected, use the old frozen configs\n5. Update the README to mention that old configs are frozen.\n6. Copy all configs to `lsp/*.lua` and port them to `vim.lsp.config`\n    - Port [commands](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/b1729954329236f59d075bec79fdee7a6f3ce88b/lua/lspconfig/configs/svlangserver.lua#L32-L41) to `on_attach` ([example](https://github.com/justinmk/config/blob/5aa55f5025435c3cf38694443d690cf25e1fd974/.config/nvim/plugin/plugins.lua#L263-L275)).\n    - Port [docs](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/b1729954329236f59d075bec79fdee7a6f3ce88b/lua/lspconfig/configs/svlangserver.lua#L42-L52) to LuaLS docstrings?\n",

The plan is to make nvim-lspconfig work with nvim 0.11 `lsp/` setup such that a user can add it as a plugin and not to have to call `vim.lsp.config()` themselves (unless they want to override or add to a config etc.) but they'd still have to call `vim.lsp.enable()` ofc\n2. The current recommendation or the \"cleanest\" way to use nvim-lspconfig right now is through this pattern\n   ```\n   vim.lsp.config(\"bashls\", require('lspconfig.configs.bashls').default_config)\n   vim.lsp.enable(\"bashls\")\n   ```",
