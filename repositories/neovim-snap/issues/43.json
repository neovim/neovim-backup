Is there any reason it is outdated (v0.7.0 on snapcraft.io) for s390x architecture?\nIt would be nice if you could update it and even better if you could ship it with luajit support.\nBecause [this](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/pull/631) doesn't get merged a solution could\nbe to replace the luajit dependency in `neovim/cmake.deps/deps.txt` with [luajit2](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2).\n\nI did a quick test on s390x Ubuntu and the snap was built successfully for neovim 0.10.4 (without luajit support).",
