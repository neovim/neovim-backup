Users install the major Linux distributions and get software from their repositories (snap is a great way of doing so if you want an up-to-date neovim).\r\n\r\nI described in #43 that we have an open pull request for LuaJIT, which is actively ignored. Some Linux distributions like openSUSE now patch their LuaJIT with our pull request before building it. I also thought about doing this here, but I decided to go for luajit2 for simplicity.\r\n\r\nI don't think that luajit2 is just any other fork if Homebrew used it. I provided a link to the latest official GitHub [release](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2/releases/tag/v2.1-20250117), not to a random commit.\r\n\r\nppc64el seems to be in the same situation as s390x, their PR is also ignored. But also here, it should work with luajit2 (I can ask them to verify if that would change your mind).\r\n\r\nThis request is just my interest as someone who loves neovim and wants to recommend it to other s390x users. But imho builds without LuaJIT aren't a solution anymore. neovim lives from its awesome plugin ecosystem. And the current situation is, that a lot of tutorials and also neovim distributions like NvChad use plugins (lazy.nvim, telescope, ..) that require a build with LuaJIT.",
