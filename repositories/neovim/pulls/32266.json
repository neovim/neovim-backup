    "body": "Problem: `autotrigger` option of `vim.lsp.completion.enable()` would trigger all clients, as long as it matched at least one client's `triggerCharacters`.\r\n\r\nSolution: trigger only the clients with triggerCharacters matching the character. overtriggering still happens if any client returns `isIncomplete=true` (this case is more involved).\r\n\r\nFor example: jdtls is really slow client especially on a big java codebase. All responses from it are laggy, if you send it requests too fast or for strange triggerCharacters, it will destabilize, start returning errors, etc. But it is worth the pain to trigger it for its triggerCharacters (e.g. `.`).\r\n\r\nI have \"fast clients\" I'd like to use on other trigger characters, e.g. `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, which just do treesitter locals, snippets, etc. But currently, I can't use them without also triggering the slow jdtls, too. With this patch, everything works together wonderfully, as clients are only triggered on the characters they should be.\r\n\r\nThis issue might just be a simple oversight: the code goes to great efforts to track a mapping of `char -> client[]` but then doesn't use the return value when actually triggering.\r\n\r\nI could use guidance on lua testing: I understand the existing tests, but I don't see how to test the `autotrigger`.
