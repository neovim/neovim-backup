            "body": "> except that the `<Find>` and `<Select>` keycodes are a bit random\r\n\r\nI wasn't the one who made them up. Those are the existing key names that Neovim *already* receives via libtermkey in this situation, as I've found out via strace between the two nvim processes – I literally saw the strings `<Find>` and `<Select>` being exchanged through the RPC from Neovim's \"frontend\" process to the \"backend\" process.\r\n\r\nBut currently Neovim completely ignores them and doesn't allow mapping them to anything else; the patch just makes that possible.\r\n\r\n> Do you have a reference for the \"DEC keys\"?\r\n\r\nI didn't dig *very* deep into why libtermkey chose those names, but my assumption is that they're named after the [DEC LK201 keyboard](https://deskthority.net/wiki/DEC_LK201) that the physical VT220 used. Looking at photos online, it had 'Find' as key 1 and 'Select' as key 4 in roughly the same area where we now have Ins/Home/Del/End, so it seems to exactly fit the ESC[1~ and ESC[4~ key sequences.\r\n\r\n[![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/31021/6c9353d8-c0e8-418a-883b-d8ea63c81969)](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:LK201AA_cursor.jpg)\r\n\r\nI'm guessing PuTTY re-purposes ESC[1~ (Find) and ESC[4~ (Select) for Home/End just to have them nicely fit in with the rest (Ins/Del and PgUp/PgDn).\r\n\r\n> Is that because of the risk of \"false positives\"?\r\n\r\nFalse positives, yes, and also – because I'm only adding existing key names that technically already have a their own meaning (even if obsolete), it didn't feel quite right to permanently map them to entirely different keys at Nvim level. This is my first patch so I was aiming for the \"least invasive\" option.\r\n\r\n(I'm actually not sure how to map them to Home/End directly – I think I could change the table in keycodes.c to `{ K_HOME, \"Find\" }`, but I think the key would still be called \"`<Find>`\" regardless?)",
