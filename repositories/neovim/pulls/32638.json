The generator scripts are quite unrelated to lint tasks.\r\n\r\nI disagree, `gcc` is a linter and a generator, `rust` and `zig` are certainly linters, and I generally always consider linting as part of the build phase. The same goes for documentation.\r\n\r\n> Dependencies are dependencies. If a lint task in scripts/ uses a lua module that happens to live in src/gen/, why is that a problem?\r\n\r\nLua tooling, which we are increasingly dependent on to help validate our code. If everything is spread out, it makes it more difficult to manage (#32582), and things rot quicker because of reduced locality.\r\n\r\nI've seen this problem manifest in other projects which have python scripts dotted about the codebase, whereas python's tooling works best when there is a dedicated python package, at least when dependencies are involved. This is because these files all need to be launched in an environment, and if the files are too scattered, it makes having a consistent launcher much more difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the 3 `.luarc`'s now roughly align with the 3/4 preload scripts we have, which means there is now exactly 4 different execution environments for any Lua code that is run in this repo.\r\n\r\n1). `nlua` in `src/gen/`: Used by most of the generator scripts to build the Nvim binary.\r\n2). `nvim_lua` in `src/gen/`: Used by `gen_vimdoc`, `gen_eval_files` and `lintdoc`\r\n3). `nvim` busted in `test/`\r\n4). `nvim` runtime in `runtime/`\r\n\r\n1). and 2). now share the same Lua package (and `.luarc`) with similar preloaders. Main difference is `nlua` doesn't have `vim.uv` or `VIMRUNTIME`\r\n\r\nThese could be split into `src/gen` and `doc`, but then we'd need a common package for files like `c_grammar.lua` etc. Seems much more pragmatic to just group these.\r\n",
