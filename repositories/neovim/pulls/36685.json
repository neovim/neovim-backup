            "body": "> Oh the highlights are hard to see in the default theme. We can solve this by using a darker bg for Statusline. @echasnovski\r\n\r\nIt was with the initial design, before #26921. That PR was a result of [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/26540#issuecomment-1874465785) that has the requirement for `StatusLine` and `StatusLineNC` to \"be clearly different so that the current window is obvious\". There was a requirement for `StatusLineNC` to be such that separation between window splits is obvious.\r\n\r\nSo my first reaction is that these are two conflicting goals:\r\n- Obvious current window means it should be highlighted with background *visibly different* from `Normal` background.\r\n- `DiagnosticSignXxx` groups require background *not very different* from `Normal` background.\r\n\r\nThere are eight shades of dark grey available to use as background for `StatusLine`. So for `bg=dark`:\r\n- `NvimDarkGrey1` (as in floating windows) - too similar to `Normal` -> not \"obvious current window\".\r\n- `NvimDarkGrey2` (as in `Normal`) - too similar to `Normal`.\r\n- `NvimDarkGrey3` (as in `CursorLine`) - fairly different from `Normal`, but same as `CursorLine`. Having that color is bad usability (as was the whole reason for ##32256).\r\n- `NvimDarkGrey4` (as in `Visual`) - fairly different from `Normal`, but same as current `StatusLineNC`. So *that* requires a change. It can be `NvimDarkGrey3`, but it might be deemed \"not clearly different from `StatusLine`\" and does not have \"obvious window splits\".\r\n- `NvimLightGrey[4-1]` all too light to have a decent contrast ratio with `DiagnosticSignXxx` groups, as they all have light foreground.\r\n\r\nMy current suggestion is to leave default color scheme be as it is now. Instead try to design things around this constraint if something is expected to be shown with default color scheme.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don't think forcing usage of any highlight group inside `vim.diagnostic.status()` (or any function that returns a \"statusline component\") is a good idea. Mostly because this makes it not usable with custom statuslines for reasons described in [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/29976#issuecomment-2411055696) and [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/35806#issuecomment-3305739678).\r\n\r\nTL;DR: foreground only highlight groups in statusline \"stack\" its background from `StatusLine` group and not from the actual statusline background surrounding it. Essentially, forcing `DiagnosticSignXxx` here (without flag even), makes `vim.diagnostic.status()` always show with background from `StatusLine` group, which is not often desirable.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion at the moment is that this PR's feature needs at least two updates:\r\n- Ability to not use highlight groups. I'd expect that to be a default behavior.\r\n- Ability to adjust highlight groups **or** introduce dedicated `DiagnosticStatuslineXxx` groups.\r\n\r\nTo add even more to this opus, having control over which highlight groups are used in `vim.diagnostic.status()` is crucial to allow it to be used in both active and not active statuslines. Those two usually have backgrounds with clearly different lightness, so \"one highlight group to fit it all\" breaks this use case.",
