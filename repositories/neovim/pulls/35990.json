In other words - if `.show()` fails for any reason (for example, if the range is OOB), we should discard the state by setting `self.current = nil` and prevent accepting the completion.\r\n\r\nI support this idea; it aligns with WYSIWYG, but I think this is a new issue beyond the scope of these two PRs we are discussing. It should be described as \"illegal completions that were not rendered can still be `accept`ed,\" whereas the common point of the two PRs we're discussing now is \"which completions should be considered illegal.\" Given how unlikely it is that someone would `accept()` an illegal completion in the very short time before a valid completion is updated without seeing the illegal completion, I would give such an issue a low priority.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do have an idea to synchronize this state. When completing the inline completion feature, I also added the initial support of `vim.range`, and I plan to add a method so we have a general way to check whether a range is out of bounds. Then we can prevent OOB completions from being rendered and discharge them. However, I'm extremely busy this year, so I don't have time to continue pushing `vim.range` at this moment.",

It likely happens because the completion range start moves past the end of the line (though language servers should \"prefer replacements over insertions to provide a better experience when the user deletes typed text\" as stated in the spec).\r\nIt seems all we need to do is validate both `col` and `row` and discard the completion if it's invalid.",
