We won't win. And we'll have to provide deprecation phases for those functions.\r\n\r\nAnd that removes a very important tool from our capabilities. It means we don't have any place that we can safely provide experimental interfaces.

            "body": "> I'm confused by the suggested distinction of \"private\" vs \"unstable\". What is the difference exactly?\r\n\r\nunstable means it is **not** subject to the strong API contract. private, at least in Lua annotations land means it can only be used internally.\r\n\r\nHowever we currently ship `nvim__redraw` which gitsigns needs https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/blob/main/lua/gitsigns/util.lua#L200 and used [here](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/blob/main/lua/gitsigns/actions.lua#L118) and [here](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/blob/main/lua/gitsigns/manager.lua#L211)\r\n\r\n> There is no migration/deprecation phase for these functions.\r\n\r\nThat's completely understood and accepted. That's part of what unstable means.\r\n\r\nMost `nvim__` functions are unlikely to be useful by plugins except for `nvim__redraw` and `nvim__get_runtime`\r\n\r\n> I get that you want code-completion of these kinds of functions.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for completion, but I already get that anyway.\r\n\r\n> My suggestion is that such functions should be matured into production functions.\r\n\r\nI don't really care. The API contract locks you into a corner so I don't mind these functions were create with `__`. `__` isn't a signal they a low quality, you can find that anywhere.\r\n\r\n> If private/internal functions have all of the conveniences of public functions, except that somewhere it happens to be documented that \"underscore is bad, mmkay?\", we just can't win. We won't win. And we'll have to provide deprecation phases for those functions.\r\n\r\nWhat!? `__` just means no strict API contract, that's all it signals. There's no winning or losing.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to provide deprecation phases for those...as they are unstable.\r\n\r\n> And that removes a very important tool from our capabilities. It means we don't have any place that we can safely provide experimental interfaces. Because those interfaces will just be treated like any other interface.\r\n\r\n`__` can be used for experimental interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's put it another way `nvim__buf_redraw_range` was stable for all of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 aand 0.9. It was then replaced with `nvim_redraw` which has been completely stable for 0.10 and likely 0.11. That's several years of product life cycle. As a plugin developer I accept the risks these functions may be changed/removed at any release, I do not need to be given notice of that.\r\n\r\n`nvim__redraw` even has as it's first line of docs as `EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change in the future.`. It's not private, it's just subject to change without notice.\r\n",

There does not exist an annotation for what you want. `@nodoc` is the closest.\n\n> The other arguments made here are a signal that nvim__redraw should be graduated into a public function. Which means it should be renamed.\n\nThat depends if the API is stable yet. If it's not then it should not be renamed.\n\n> That's nice, but the Neovim project has to think about the common case. \"Nudging\" plugin authors who may not be fully paying attention, through whatever mechanisms possible, is helpful and high-leverage. That is targeting a much wider audience than the more-attentive plugin authors.\n\nI'm not sure what is gained by \"nudging\" a plugin developer about using an API that has no stable alternative.\n\n> We don't have any way to signal \"experimental\" differently than \"internal\". And it's probably too confusing to try to make that distinction.\n\nThe only tools we have for either of these are documentation and naming scheme.\n\n> The primary point I want to make is that we need to stop trying to make it easier to use experimental things. Otherwise we cannot win against the general swarm of implict expectations that emerges over time.\n\nTo reiterate, this is purely about the use of `@private` which is incorrect here and we don't use it like this with any other experimental interface, which instead we just do not document.",
