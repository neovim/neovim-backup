    "body": "This PR adds a single commit on top of #29632.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nProblem: calling `vim.filetype.match()` has performance bottleneck in\r\n  that it has to match a lot of Lua patterns against several versions of\r\n  input file name. This might be the problem if users need to call it\r\n  synchronously a lot of times.\r\n\r\nSolution: add \"parent pattern pre-matching\" which can be used to quickly\r\n  reject several potential pattern matches at (usually rare) cost of\r\n  adding time for one extra Lua pattern match.\r\n\r\n  \"Parent pattern\" is a manually added/tracked grouping of filetype\r\n  patterns which should have two properties:\r\n    - Match at least the same set of strings as its filetype patterns.\r\n      But not too much more.\r\n    - Be fast to match.\r\n\r\n  For them to be effective, group should consist from at least three\r\n  filetype patterns.\r\n\r\n  Example: for a filetpye pattern \".*/etc/a2ps/.*%.cfg\", both \"/etc/\"\r\n  and \"%.cfg\" are good parent patterns (prefer the one which can group\r\n  more filetype patterns).\r\n\r\n  After this commit, `vim.filetype.match()` on most inputs runs ~3.4\r\n  times faster (while some inputs may see less impact if they match\r\n  many parent patterns).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- There is more description about the \"fast pattern\" approach in the new section of 'dev_vimpatch.txt'\r\n- Technically, this can already be used in filetype patterns added via `vim.filetype.add()`, but it is left intentionally undocumented. If it will be decided as a good idea to document, then I'd happily do it (but I'd imagine it is not).\r\n- This is the (almost) the best I can do to optimize performance of `vim.filetype.match()` without breaking compatibility. The only other reasonable route I can think of is to add `skip_slow` flag to `vim.filetype.match()` options which would skip all pattern matching (and possibly content matching). This will not detect filetype for *some* files, but get somewhat faster execution in return (actual speedup is less significant after this PR).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nProfiling results on some different `filename` inputs (computed in debug builds by measuring 10000 calls of `vim.filetype.match({ filename = 'xxx', buf = buf_id })` with empty buffer and taking median value; executed in '/home/user/repos/neovim' directory; \"before fastpat\" is recomputed today):\r\n\r\nFilename | Before fastpat | After fastpat |\r\n--------------|-----------|--------------|\r\ninit.lua | 0.107ms  | 0.030ms |\r\nno-match | 0.128ms | 0.037ms |\r\n/home/user/.config/hello/world/no-match | 0.201ms | 0.059ms |\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nInteresting details:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Motivation on why optimizing pattern matching is the bottleneck</summary>\r\n\r\nHere is what `vim.filetype.match()` currently tries (in order):\r\n\r\n- Exact match for full name. Fast with table lookup (420 entries).\r\n- Exact match for basename/tail. Fast table lookup (420 entries).\r\n- Pattern match for 355 patterns with positive priority. *Very slow*, as each match is either `string.match()` for _both_ filename as typed and full path (majority of cases) or a single match for basename.\r\n- Extension match for computed extension. Fast table lookup (even with 1092+ entries).\r\n- Similar pattern match for 94 patterns with negative priority. Same method as for positive priority.\r\n- Match based on content.\r\n\r\nAs matching by extension is (arguably) the most common real world case, reducing execution time of mandatory matching of positive priority patterns is the best way to get overall performance improvement.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Summary of actually used fast patterns, separately for regular patterns with positive/negative priority and total</summary>\r\n\r\nFast pattern | Positive priority | Negative priority | All patterns |\r\n-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|\r\n'/etc/'      |         79        |         24        |      103     |\r\n''           |         62        |         29        |      91      |\r\n'/log/'      |         77        |         0         |      77      |\r\n'/conf'      |         27        |         1         |      28      |\r\n'%.conf'     |         14        |         10        |      24      |\r\n'/systemd/'  |         17        |         0         |      17      |\r\n'utt'        |         7         |         10        |      17      |\r\n'file'       |         6         |         4         |      10      |\r\n'/%.'        |         8         |         1         |      9       |\r\n'^%.'        |         7         |         2         |      9       |\r\n'/usr/'      |         4         |         5         |      9       |\r\n'git/'       |         6         |         1         |      7       |\r\n'%.cfg'      |         6         |         0         |      6       |\r\n'bash'       |         5         |         0         |      5       |\r\n's6'         |         5         |         0         |      5       |\r\n'/debian/'   |         4         |         0         |      4       |\r\n'/var/'      |         4         |         0         |      4       |\r\n'cmus/'      |         4         |         0         |      4       |\r\n'fvwm'       |         0         |         4         |      4       |\r\n'nginx'      |         4         |         0         |      4       |\r\n'calendar/'  |         0         |         3         |      3       |\r\n'proj%.user$'|         3         |         0         |      3       |\r\n'sst%.meta'  |         3         |         0         |      3       |\r\n'require'    |         3         |         0         |      3       |\r\n\r\n</details>",

It is harmful to cache regular filetype matching as it is used at most once.\r\n\r\nThe general \"parse and generate tree\" which works like nested `if ... then ... else` *and* also respects priority sorting can indeed remove the need for caching. However it feels like having small extra reward for a single filetype matching stuff compared to the complexity it entails.",

This did not 100% work, because they can be followed by modifiers or (in theory) be inside character set (like trying to find 'git/' pattern in a valid '.*[git/]' pattern).\n\n> I would imagine you would need to tokenize the patterns, generate a tree with each node being a single token, and then flatten the tree. \n\nTo me *this* sounds more convoluted. Besides, the core optimization idea is to decrease number of attempts at pattern matching. This automated approach seems to lead to more overly specific patterns (if I understood what \"tokenize the patterns\" means) with less performance gain. Having a bit of human touch when picking fast patterns I'd say results in the best performance.\n\n> > That's almost exactly what is done here but instead using \"fastpat\" option as \"parent pattern\".\n> \n> Almost, but more convoluted. Why not make the parent pattern more explicit, and allow multiple of them.\n\nIt is as explicit as it gets - right next to the regular filetype pattern. So instead of creating new nested structures, reuse the current ones (which is a less convoluted solution).

            "body": "> To me this sounds more convoluted. Besides, the core optimization idea is to decrease number of attempts at pattern matching. This automated approach seems to lead to more overly specific patterns (if I understood what \"tokenize the patterns\" means) with less performance gain. Having a bit of human touch when picking fast patterns I'd say results in the best performance.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that you understand then. Tree decoders are a well understood construct. How do you think your CPU decodes an instruction?\r\n\r\nTokenize means split something like `.*/log/.*` -> `.*` `/` `l` `o` `g` `/` `.*`\r\n\r\nDo this for all patterns and create a tree on each of these tokens for all the given patterns.\r\n\r\nE.g. for patterns `.*/log/a` and `.*/log/b` you would generate a tree like.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nif c:match('^.*') then\r\n  if c:match('^.*/') then\r\n    if c:match('^.*/l') then\r\n      if c:match('^.*/lo') then\r\n        if c:match('^.*/log') then\r\n          if c:match('^.*/log/') then\r\n            if c:match('^.*/log/a$') then\r\n              return 'a'\r\n            elseif c:match ('^.*/log/b$') then\r\n              return 'b'\r\n            end\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would then flatten this tree to something like:\r\n```lua\r\nif c:match('^.*/log/') then\r\n  if c:match('^.*/log/a$') then\r\n    return 'a'\r\n  elseif c:match ('^.*/log/b$') then\r\n    return 'b'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have 50 patterns beginning with `.*/log`, you would then only perform 2-50 pattern matches. And this would not need the whole `fastpat` caching thing since you never repeat a match. Therefore, this would be the most performant as it puts less pressure on memory.\r\n\r\nYou could optimise this further with something like:\r\n```lua\r\nlocal h, t = c:match('^(.*/log/)(.*)$')\r\nif h then\r\n  if t:match('^a$') then\r\n    return 'a'\r\n  elseif t:match('^b$') then\r\n    return 'b'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut like I said, to begin with we could construct this tree by hand, but generating it would maximise the performance gain as it would minimise the amount of patterns.\r\n\r\n> It is as explicit as it gets - right next to the regular filetype pattern. So instead of creating new nested structures, reuse the current ones (which is a less convoluted solution). It also is \"backwards compatible\": adding new filetype patterns can be done in exact same way (adding fast patterns is encouraged but is optional).\r\n\r\nExcept you needed to write an entire thesis to describe how it works. I'm sure if you spend enough time studying it in a bubble then it's easy enough to understand, but it is definitely more convoluted than a standard tree decoder.",
