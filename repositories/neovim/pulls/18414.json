    "body": "WIP: sketching out how Nvim `--remote` should work. (Followup to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17856#pullrequestreview-951127037 )\r\n\r\nKey ideas:\r\n\r\n* The numerous `--remote-x-y` variants from Vim should not be mindlessly copied. Most use of `--remote` is for small one-liner shortcuts. Any non-trivial use of Vim's `--remote` is not going to work with Nvim because we don't and won't have exactly the same interface. So we can instead just make a better interface.\r\n* If possible, the only `--remote` variant we will support is... `--remote`. Not the other stuff.\r\n* The usual Nvim CLI options like `-p`, `-es`, etc., should \"just work\". For example,\r\n    * `-p --remote` should work, then `--remote-tab` isn't needed.\r\n    * `-es \"+echo 1+1\" --remote` should work, then `--remote-expr` isn't needed.\r\n    * `echo <keys> | nvim -s - --remote` should work, then `--remote-send` isn't needed.\r\n        * Alternatively `\"+call nvim_input('<keys>')\"`\r\n\r\nAnother note about the current behavior:\r\n\r\n    This doesn't work, all arguments after --remote will be used as file names: >\r\n        nvim --remote --server ~/.cache/nvim/server.pipe file.txt\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of that? We already have `--` (`:help ---`) for declaring \"all args hereafter are filenames\".\r\n\r\nclose #18531\r\nclose #18519",

            "body": "Here's my immediate reactions on reading this:\r\n* Is there any point to having a `--remote` flag now? With this, it feels like `--server` says do what you would normally do with these command line args but in the given server. That makes `--remote` feel redundant since you have to specify an address. Dropping the remote flag altogether has the benefit of making it clearer that this isn't flag-for-flag compatible with vim\r\n* I agree with @Shougo that wait feature is quite useful. If you look at the [wait code in the existing PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17856/files#diff-79965f18e45c27a2d629630a82c115f9fb93ccfb1c7ed9e6a42125e56a8bf48dR684), it's definitely the most obnoxious bit to implement. I'm also not super happy with how it's tied to waiting for BufUnload. That matches the Vim behavior, but it's not as clear a choice for an event as NeoVim has hidden on by default. It seems like we should either use a separate event or allow the user to easily specify what condition they'd like to wait on or something like that. No good mechanism is jumping out at me though.\r\n* The way the Vim implementation allows you to become the server if there isn't something listening on that address has been helpful for me in the past. I don't like how it does that by default though, makes it easy for stuff to break silently. Maybe we could add a  `--listen-if-no-server` flag to allow that? Should probably figure out a better name though 😂 \r\n* The current NeoVim remote implementation doesn't load plugins or user config to let it get to issuing RPC calls with as little overhead as possible. I _think_ that should be fine with this proposal since we're not really running user code in the client and I don't think users would expect to have their plugins loaded as a result. Wanted to call it out in case there's something I'm missing though.\r\n* I imagine we'd want to come up with a list of flags that are disallowed like `-i`, `-m`, `-n`, `-r`, `-R`. Would want to have the client exit if they're specified in combination with `--server` so the user isn't confused when they do nothing.\r\n* Maybe there's another smaller set that we document as affecting the client, not the server? `-V`, `--startuptime`, `-v`\r\n* Should `-u <config>` get the server to load a config file? There's so many command line options that could conceivably be sent to the server: `-o`, `-O`, `-t`, `-q`,  `+[num]`, `+/{pat}`, `-S {file}`, etc. Maybe we want to add those to a not-currently-implemented list that bails on startup and let people add them as they find the need? Feels daunting to try to get all of them at once.",
