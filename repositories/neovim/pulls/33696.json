It is a good choice for that.\r\n\r\nWe need a common chord prefix for window-related commands. There are many more similar commands that could use this common chord, such as ALT-n for `:enew`, ALT-t for a new tab, etc.\r\n\r\n> Having to unmap new nvim defaults for just this reason is a bit much.\r\n\r\nTo unblock this, I'm in favor of some sort of option like `g:default_mappings`, or even a command like `g<BS>` (for the `nvim --clean` case).
