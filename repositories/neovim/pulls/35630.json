Such \"broken\" tests can easily be merged, since there is no CI to ensure proper cleanup. To me, it still makes sense to gitignore generated files that are never meant to be staged, because the test runner can be killed or fail to delete them for other reasons.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if they aren't supposed to remain, I'll submit a fix to ensure proper test cleanup.",

On my machine, it takes longer to close, so the logs are being written after `after_each` executes. Ignoring them with .gitignore is not really a solution, the real fix would be to handle subprocesses exit properly and wait before cleanup, but I don't think this is a high-priority problem right now.\r\n\r\nMaybe the compromise is to temporarily ignore them. Moving these files into a subdir could also make things cleaner.",
