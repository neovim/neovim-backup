    "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nThe system version of ConPTY in kernel32.dll is old and will mangle some VT sequences sent by shells. For example:\r\n* https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/12166\r\n* https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/17313\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nNewer versions of ConPTY available as part of the Windows Terminal project fix this by passing through VT sequences unmodified when the terminal has set ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT. This change allows users to fix buggy behaviour of Neovim's terminal on Windows by copying conpty.dll to Neovim's bin directory.\r\n\r\nA PR for this was closed back in 2019 (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12137), but wasn't merged because the official packages for conpty.dll and OpenConsole.exe had not been released. The package hasn't been \"productized\" yet (https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/15065), but binaries are available from https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases, and redistribution is apparently permitted (https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/15740). An updated conpty.dll is also distributed with current versions of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n(I spent a while trying to figure out why Neovim's new `:h terminal_[[` motion wasn't working properly in Nushell, and after tracing the problem through https://github.com/nushell/nushell, https://github.com/nushell/reedline and https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm, eventually worked out that the old ConPTY was rewriting `ESC [ J` (Erase Display, which isn't supposed to move the cursor) to a sequence of `ESC [ K` (Erase Line) and `LF`s (which does, confusing Neovim about the cursor location when the OSC 9 sequence is emitted to identify the prompt location). Being able to solve similar problems without building your own Neovim would probably save others some trouble. This has been implemented in Alacritty: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/6994.)",
