            "body": "I am closing this PR because I found that it also cannot truly allow the server to fully control the data, which is limited by the overall design of `inlay_hint.lua`.\r\n\r\nIn detail, much of the logic in `inlay_hint.lua` is based on the assumption that \"inlay hints displayed in the buffer only change after the buffer is modified,\" so it tracks the buffer version and displays them on demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the server requests a refresh of inlay hints through `workspace/inlayHint/refresh`, the buffer version may not necessarily change. This causes many logics to malfunction after receiving `workspace/inlayHint/refresh`. It may require further refactoring to completely resolve all issues.",
