Create vietnamese.txt\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nThe Vietnamese keymaps in Vim is quite different from corresponding input methods that Vietnamese people use, so I think there should be a help document that tell users these differences\r\n\r\n**Edit : The file vietnamese.txt has been removed because I have sent it to Vim**\r\n\r\n## 2. Update vi.po\r\nSurprisingly, the file `vi.po` in Neovim has so many errors, though fortunately they are mostly related to Vimscript runtime error or some other unpopular (and even removed) features. I have yet found an error in Vim's `vi.po` btw.  I have fixed many errors (but I think there may still some left), and add translation for a few other messages.\r\n\r\n## Other questions\r\nVim provides Vimtutor for many languages, but there doesn't seem to be a way to open any localized Vimtutor in Vim. The only way I know is using `vimtutor` command in terminal, but it doesn't open the tutor in Vim. So I would like to know if this is intentional, or should I open an issue for this?",
