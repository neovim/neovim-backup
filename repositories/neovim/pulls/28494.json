            "body": "@MariaSolOs  Thanks for pointing this out, I hadn't noticed that `vim.lsp.codelens.clear` also uses this function. But in my opinion, if the functions have the same name (even if they are defined in different places), it's best if they do the same thing. So far, it seems that the most useful use of this function is to treat `nil` as the current buffer, not all buffers.\r\n\r\nI think the problem you mentioned is essentially due to the design of this API. The current codelens API is designed to be easily triggered manually. In this case, we may need a method to indicate that it is effective for all buffers. However, for other LSP-related APIs, such as semantic token or inlay hint, `nil` represents the current buffer, not all buffers. So for the consistency of the API, I even suggest changing this behavior, but this will be another breaking change, so it is better not to do it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the stuff I am trying to work on is rewriting codelens to provide something like `vim.lsp.codelens.enable` like `vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable`, I see `vim.diagnostic` made a similar change recently, so it should be acceptable, and the we have no more special case like this.",

But it's a bit hard to implement. There are a few problems we may encounter.\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes the `bufnr` is not a direct parameter for these API functions, it might be wrapped in a table, e.g. `opts.bufnr` in `vim.lsp.codelens.refresh` and `filter.bufnr` in `vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable`, should we do this in these places?\r\n2. The current implementation of many of these functions, like `vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable`, needs a lot of work to make it take effect on all buffers, because \r\n    1. `0` or any specific number is for one buffer, this is how these functions are designed;\r\n    2. Intuitively, \"all buffers\" should not only refer to \"all current buffers,\" but also include all future buffers. For `vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable`, all current buffers should be enabled, and the same for the future buffers.\r\n\r\nThen like @gpanders said, we do not need these \"resolve\" helper functions at all. So the best way I can think of at the moment is,  to delete all resolve_bufnr functions. If a function can handle the \"all buffer\" situation, then `bufnr` is optional; otherwise at least `0` must be passed as `bufnr`. Since we have lua_ls and a lot of annotations, this should not be a big problem. Then we can gradually add support for processing \"all buffers\" to the functions in need, or think that this function should only handle one buffer, and then mark `bufnr` as required instead of optional. \r\n\r\nHowever, this approach maintains API consistency.\r\n",
