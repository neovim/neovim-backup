It seems like pull diagnostics are the \"future\" of lsp diagnostics so that the client is in control of when to pull, instead of every server having different implementations and settings. If so, it seems useful for neovim to start supporting settings for it. I could imagine this becoming a full field on vim.lsp.ClientConfig later, like `pull_diagnostics_on` with settings like `change`, `save`, `normal_mode`, etc. Open to other thoughts and ideas!",

What do you think about for now adding a simpler setting in the lsp client config to disable pull diagnostics? Right now it requires some relatively deep knowledge of lsp servers, capabilities, and how neovim implemented pull diagnostics. I'll admit when I tried to disable them I couldn't get it to work. It could be in `flags` or in the `ClientConfig` directly, but something like `pull_diagnostics boolean` or `disable_pull_diagnostics boolean`? What do you think?\r\n",
