Nvim's current constraint presumably makes plugins much simpler because they don't have to deal with out-of-order responses.\r\n\r\nI think we will not break it. Because the plugin that changes behavior with this change should now be unusable with the error \"ch * returned a response with an unknown requestid\".\r\n\r\nAlso, you say that the current restrictions are simplifying the plugins, but I feel that they are making it even more difficult, since the plugins rather need to return responses to Neovim in order (since normal msgpack RPC would just return them in the order in which they were processed).\r\n\r\n> Does that make sense though? The constraint does not make sense for sequential requests (they must be answered in the same sequence anyways, since neovim blocks on a request, and I don't see this being negotiable), and requests can't \"truly\" overlap (for the same reason), but only nest. And nested requests need to be answered in reverse order to make any sense. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something :)\r\n\r\nI think it is true that if a Peer calls multiple Neovim processes, they are returned in order. I think it is a little different because the problem in this case is that when Neovim reads multiple processes of Peer, the responses are not returned in the order in which they were read.\r\n\r\nIf Neovim is using msgpack RPC, it should be able to handle the responses even if they are not in order.",
