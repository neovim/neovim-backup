    "body": "Problem:\r\n\r\nbw_rest was used as an extra buffer to save incomplete byte sequences between calls to buf_write_bytes. Besides being unnecessarily complicated, this introduced a number of issues:\r\n\r\n1) The bytes stored in bw_rest could still be there at the end of writing the file, never having been written, thus losing some of the file content on write.\r\n\r\n2) bw_rest was not cleared out after the \"checking_conversion\" phase, leaving them to affect the written file content during the writing phase, corrupting the file.\r\n\r\n3) bw_rest could contain extra bytes that need to be written to the output buffer during a buf_write_convert call, potentially before any bytes are consumed. But some conversions are in-place, without a separate output buffer. Writing bytes from bw_rest to the \"output\" buffer actually overwrote bytes from the input buffer before they were read, corrupting the data to be written.\r\n\r\n4) The extra bytes in bw_rest that need to be written to the conversion output buffer were not originally accounted for in the size calculation for the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow (previously fixed in Vim patch 9.1.2028).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nRather than maintaining a separate buffer, the unconverted bytes at the end of the buffer can just be shifted to the beginning of the buffer, and the buffer size updated. This requires a bit of refactoring, and buf_write_convert and buf_write_convert_with_iconv need to report the number of bytes they consumed so that buf_write_bytes can handle the remaining bytes.\r\n\r\nFollowing conversion, bw_buf can be checked for any remaining bytes. Leftover bytes in this case result in a conversion error, which is better than silently dropping them.\r\n\r\nA short section of dead code was removed from buf_write_convert, for converting a non-UTF-8 buffer to UTF-8. Neovim buffers are always UTF-8.\r\n\r\nA few additional tests for iconv conversions have been added. Vim's iconv tests are disabled in Neovim because they use unsupported values for 'encoding'.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Thank you for contributing to Neovim!\r\n  If this is your first time, check out https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests-prs\r\n  for our PR guidelines.\r\n-->\r\n",
