But right now, current tools are built to use these files.\n\n> it's another source of truth that may get outdated\n\nIt most definitely will, which is why this particular AGENTS.md file contains a directive on the last line to update this file automatically, which AI added itself.\n\n> Why can't the agent read the README.md + BUILD.MD?\n\nIt can but that isn't the most efficient. The point of AGENTS.md file is to provide a condensed summary of all these various sources of information, which we have a lot of.\n\n> In other words, in the worst case, AGENTS.md should be a couple lines like:\n\nWe can strip this down if you want, that's fine. Though this file was generated by the AI after scanning the project, and is expected to update as AI runs. It's not something we are expected to strictly maintain. Though we may update it now and again if someone notices a task an LLM is regularly wasting tokens on.\n\nThough just pointing it to other files isn't necessarily enough.\n\n> If agents can't find that info then neither can humans. What improvements do we need to make?\n\nIf needed the agent will decompile executables to find relevant information it needs. I saw that happen in one session yesterday when it decompiled a java application to better understand how a particular CLI argument works. That work however costs tokens and a portion of the AI's available context, and the role of AGENTS.md is to give enough context to the model for most tasks with as condensed summary as possible. That's not quite the same as a README.md file which is higher level and often contains information not relevant to an AI model.\n\n> LLMs should be pointed to the relevant docs for context; if these don't suffice, they should be improved\".\n\nI do think this suggests a bit of a misunderstanding of how to properly use LLM's. Yes, you can just point it to a big heap of documentation, and it will probably figure out what it needs, but probably isn't the best use of tokens.",
