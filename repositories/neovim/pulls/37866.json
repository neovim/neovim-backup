Scanned through a couple I have and I only saw it used to filter lists.\r\n\r\nThat said, I did get 117 plugin results even after filtering out docs, so bumping vim.deprecate to v0.14 seems like the right idea.\r\n\r\n> `vim.iter()` can iterate tables in a much nicer way. A non-iterator version (without the problems of `vim.tbl_filter()`) is a good idea (`vim.table.filter()`), but imo it's not a blocking issue for merging this PR.\r\n\r\nvim.iter() definitely helps, but it still returns the results as a list of string tuples rather than the original structure.\r\n\r\n",
