So if you want to expand one particular version you no longer know which you have to select - making it worse if there is no other way to display that information.\r\n\r\nI think this is a separate problem, of which there may be many solutions? I also think it is only a problem for certain languages like java, that aren't even usable at all today. For this PR I just went with \"minimal\", maybe I went too minimal? With labelDetailsSupport, all that data is still there... and formatted in a more useful way. The problem is where to put it all, and I argue what we are doing today isn't great. \r\n\r\nPersonally, i use a custom convert() function, with simple `string.format` truncation, similar to vscode. And I shove the full `details` into the popup, with horizontal separator above any documentation.  It is ugly but just showing that your issue can be solved without signature help.\r\n\r\n![Screen_Shot_2025-03-17_at_20 11 41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e73972a-4459-40b2-949c-fca5311aab4e)\r\n\r\nIf you want, we could split this change up. I can turn on labelDetails in a way that doesn't change the pum at all, just makes the new data fields available. This just means setting `abbr` to `abbr + labelDetails.detail` so that it looks like it did before, and using full 'detail' column (which is wildly inappropriate here in the java case to show in the pum at all) instead of `labelDetails.description` which is actually documented in the spec as being something that should be displayed beside the word.\r\n\r\nLabelDetailsSupport is useful on its own for anyone that passes their own `convert`. Then we could separately decide what to do with all the data?",
