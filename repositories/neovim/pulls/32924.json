I can turn on labelDetails in a way that doesn't change the pum at all, just makes the new data fields available. This just means setting `abbr` to `abbr + labelDetails.detail` so that it looks like it did before, and using full 'detail' column (which is wildly inappropriate here in the java case to show in the pum at all) instead of `labelDetails.description` which is actually documented in the spec as being something that should be displayed beside the word.\r\n\r\nLabelDetailsSupport is useful on its own for anyone that passes their own `convert`. Then we could separately decide what to do with all the data?",
