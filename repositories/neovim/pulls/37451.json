            "body": "As an FYI to the maintainers, I'll likely have one last followup to this which will change the way range requests are used. The LSP spec itself says that /range should only be used to help with showing highlights quicker when first opening a file, or when implementing /full would be too expensive:\r\n\r\n> Requesting semantic tokens for a range\r\n>\r\n> There are two uses cases where it can be beneficial to only compute semantic tokens for a visible range:\r\n>\r\n> -    for faster rendering of the tokens in the user interface when a user opens a file. In this use cases servers should also implement the [textDocument/semanticTokens/full](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#semanticTokens_fullRequest) request as well to allow for flicker free scrolling and semantic coloring of a minimap.\r\n> -    if computing semantic tokens for a full document is too expensive servers can only provide a range call. In this case the client might not render a minimap correctly or might even decide to not show any semantic tokens at all.\r\n\r\nVSCode (and other lsp client implementations, like coc.nvim) will request both full and range requests simultaneously and show whichever response arrives first. Once the first full response is completely processed, they will switch to only using full (or /delta) requests from that point forward and drop the range requests.\r\n\r\nI am working on a change that makes neovim do this as well. The benefit is that we'll be able to use range responses _until_ the first full response is processed. The original issue that was considered the impetus for the way we added range support (#23026) was for reducing lag with large files. That specific issue was resolved a long time ago with the yielding coroutine. We still want to support range for the reasons stated above: quicker results when opening large files, and for servers that _only_ support /range and not full or delta. If full and delta are supported, switching over to those after the first full result is processed is considered best practice and is what other editors do.",
