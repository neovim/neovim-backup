    "body": "Thought I would open this up early to get some feedback on direction, requirements, etc., and if nothing else restart and focus the discussion about a default colorscheme for Neovim. I read through the old threads and took a look at the offerings before coming up with a more modern version that I think does a better job than vim-kalisi at being a stable, middle-of-the-road workhorse which follows best practices and (hopefully) offends noone's sensibilities. I did some work contributing and testing the revamped vim 9 colorschemes, so I've developed a decent amount of understanding in the \"intricacies\" of Vim/Neovim colorschemes (HINT: they are so so many...)\r\n\r\nThis PR is just the colorscheme itself, I'm not sure how we would implement it in the end, I'm fine with Lua or doing some other way. The explanation and some back story/requirements I set for myself are in the repo at [craigmac/neo](https://github.com/craigmac/neo). \r\n\r\nI could link to some images here but they are likely to break, it'd suggest instead if you are interested in trying it out and providing constructive feedback that you just copy and paste it into e.g., `~/.config/nvim/colors/neo.vim` and run `:colorscheme neo`.\r\n",
