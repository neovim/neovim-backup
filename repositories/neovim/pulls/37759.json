It's just not clear to me if the fix was part of the `vim.diagnostics` subsystem, or if it only applies to LSP. It looks to me like `on_publish_diagnostics` is mostly a wrapper around [vim.diagnostic.set()](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/4260f73e139601f7118b631e4f7ea4b6029e353f/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/diagnostic.lua#L241). \r\n\r\nOTOH, the `vim.diagnostic` subsystem is implicitly tested by this. But generally it's better to avoid as much in the LSP layer as possible.",
