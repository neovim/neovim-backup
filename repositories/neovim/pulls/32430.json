It can put neovim in the position to ship more and more prepackaged components and I can see that we would end up on the same situation of the web all over again. Also for what I've seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUzdcB_PFJA) justin goes against this type of direction by calling explicitly out [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim) witch it offers a [tree component](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/tree/main/lua/nui/tree) like the one you are suggesting.\r\n\r\nI think for the core make sense to stick to a more traditional vim style ui mentality in witch we treat the buffer as this freely organized set of data (there is this [OG vim article](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/) that I think represent this really well)).",

It can put neovim in the position to ship more and more prepackaged components and I can see that we would end up on the same situation of the web all over again. Also for what I've seen in this video justin goes against this type of direction by calling explicitly out nui.nvim witch it offers a tree component like the one you are suggesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf something should be in core or not is always a bit of a discussion and in the end a judgement call weighting different aspects like size and complexity, leverage and if already existing other components can benefit from it - or if it helps with other core functionality already on the radar. That seems to be the case here.\r\n\r\nAs for how to approach this: There's quite a bit of design space, so I suspect the bar for a final `vim.ui.tree` will be rather high and involve quite a bit of discussion. To lower the bar a bit it could be an option to go for a private `vim.ui._tree` for now that allows us to iterate on the API until we have something that's used in more than one place to confirm the design is working.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where to put the fs tree view that's built on top, maybe `vim.fs.tree()` or `vim.fs.inspect()`?\r\n",

If nobody is working on a `vim.ui.tree` component I think a good approach would be to first include the new directory viewer and then decouple its ui logic to a `vim.ui.tree` module, at least it is what I'm gonna do because frankly I'm having more fun hacking on the viewer rather that thinking about `vim.ui.tree` first.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in see the progress of the fork I'll link it [here](https://github.com/saccarosium/explorer.nvim/tree/main).

See https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim#faq\r\n> -- lewis6991\r\n\r\nIn this PR I have a dirvish like file viewer that it is about 264LOC. The only thing missing is concealed filepaths witch I couldn't figure it out how to do them without creating a syntax file for it the old vim way.\r\n\r\nI'm also working on a tree file manager ([here](https://github.com/saccarosium/explorer.nvim)) currently is much larger at around 1530LOC but has the potential to become much much smaller with some refactoring since the plugin I've forked from was doing a lot of cruft do to a lot of things for witch there are now lua APIs.\r\n\r\nI think the tree file manager has lots more potential to becoming good and been both more feature rich and more familiar for new and experienced users. Also if we than decouple it's tree logic to a separate component it will reduce it's complexity and size by a lot.\r\n\r\nAlso it's worth noting that adding oil.nvim like action to the file manager won't be really that much simpler in either case, in fact I believe that would be actually much easier doing it on a file manager that exposes directly a selection API rather than doing in a arbitrary buffer.\r\n\r\n> The basic network and file management API should not require it. \r\n> -- clason\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate more on this point? If you have a tree file manager you *need* to have a way to select a node to act on it. So what do you mean when you say  \"the file management API should not require it\"?",
