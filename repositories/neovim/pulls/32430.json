It can put neovim in the position to ship more and more prepackaged components and I can see that we would end up on the same situation of the web all over again. Also for what I've seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUzdcB_PFJA) justin goes against this type of direction by calling explicitly out [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim) witch it offers a [tree component](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/tree/main/lua/nui/tree) like the one you are suggesting.\r\n\r\nI think for the core make sense to stick to a more traditional vim style ui mentality in witch we treat the buffer as this freely organized set of data (there is this [OG vim article](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/) that I think represent this really well)).",

It can put neovim in the position to ship more and more prepackaged components and I can see that we would end up on the same situation of the web all over again. Also for what I've seen in this video justin goes against this type of direction by calling explicitly out nui.nvim witch it offers a tree component like the one you are suggesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf something should be in core or not is always a bit of a discussion and in the end a judgement call weighting different aspects like size and complexity, leverage and if already existing other components can benefit from it - or if it helps with other core functionality already on the radar. That seems to be the case here.\r\n\r\nAs for how to approach this: There's quite a bit of design space, so I suspect the bar for a final `vim.ui.tree` will be rather high and involve quite a bit of discussion. To lower the bar a bit it could be an option to go for a private `vim.ui._tree` for now that allows us to iterate on the API until we have something that's used in more than one place to confirm the design is working.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where to put the fs tree view that's built on top, maybe `vim.fs.tree()` or `vim.fs.inspect()`?\r\n",
