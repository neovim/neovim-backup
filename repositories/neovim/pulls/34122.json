And your version degrades (not that much so) with long non-whitespace strings (I think I have tested something similar, and because I wasn't aware of `shared.lua` limitations I had come up with that solution). Try to replace spaces in str1 to any char). And current `string.match()` is good for long non-whitespace strings.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed it does. This is easily fixable, though:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal trim4 = function(s)\r\n  s = s:sub(1, 1):match('%s') and s:gsub('^%s+', '') or s\r\n  s = s:sub(-1, -1):match('%s') and s:gsub('%s+$', '') or s\r\n  return s\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmarks for previous cases are the same.

Usually having several non-anchored quantified patterns adds performance problems.",

You were right `assert` in the tests always true, because it checks only if first arg is truthy ( not nil ).\r\nBut at the same time you have confused me - pattern `%s` doesn't respect \"IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE\" char either. And current `vim.trim` doesn't trim it. So using loops and string.byte is viable solution and behaves the same as trimming with lua patterns `%s` and `%S`.\r\nMaybe in modern UTF-8 era it should detect such chars, but it is out of scope of this implementation.\r\n",
