I'm open to any changes. Initially I had asked the user on startup a y/n question to show the diff, but that quickly got annoying.\r\n\r\n@gpanders I studied your runtime plugin while doing this, so it would be great if you could help review it\r\n\r\n@justinmk any thoughts would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nEdit to clarify: opt out completely with `vim.g.news_check = false` (or equivalent vim script `let g:news_check = v:false`) - it's the first check we make",

I'll do some exploring here to see if I can make that work without having to add another variable/cache thing like the 'seen news'  you mention. I briefly tried this approach when I discovered myself some of these cases. It quickly became unmanageable for me in trying to track and update/compare all of it. My concession was to just throw up my hands and just notify the user \"news has changed, run this command if you want to\".",
