But if Vim detects a vimrc file, Vi-compatible will be disabled. This doesn't apply to Neovim.\r\n\r\n- Lesson 7.3 teachs an important way to discover Nvim features, so users should learn it before they start configuring Nvim\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [ ] Add `*lua-vs-vimscript*` in `:h faq.txt` and refers to it in Tutor (and `nvim-quickstart`, but in another PR?).",

That's also why it is put before lesson 7.3, because lesson 7.3 can't work in Vi-compat.\n\nIt was not until 2 months ago that someone sent this patch https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/397700e50780325fbd2a4ce15225b983c018a93f and made lesson 7.2 something more than just disabling Vi-compat\n\n> But it looks like this is more about creating a config file. That definitely should be in the Tutor. \n\nOk, but I will suggest to move it to after lesson 7.3 \"Using completion\". Lesson 7.3 teaches an important way to discover Nvim features, I consider it a prerequisite before users start to configure Nvim. \n\nBeside that, maybe the lesson about configuring Nvim must also compare pro, con of Lua and Vimscript, which would put a cognitive overhead to users, so I would prefer to make it the final lesson of Nvim Tutor\n\nAn alternative solution is https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33524, where I refer to `:h nvim-quickstart` in section `# What's next` of `:Tutor`",
