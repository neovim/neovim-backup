My point is that for files under `lua`, do we really _need_ to make a distinctions between \"stdlib” and \"plugins\"? So far we have not, and I think that has made things better (compared to Vim). Especially since this only applies to a small number (2 or 3) of modules, which makes me believe that introducing (and documenting and _enforcing_) this distinction is not going to be worth it.\r\n\r\nOr do you have a concrete plan in mind for adding more \"plugins\" that would change the payoff?",

We would of course keep the convention that underscored modules are internal-only and not documented.\r\n\r\nSo the pattern would be:\r\n1. stdlib: `vim.treesitter`, always available from the `vim` global\r\n2. bundled plugins: `require('vim.editorconfig')`, included in the documentation (new category)\r\n3. internal implementation modules: `require('vim._man')` (assuming this will stay internal), not included in the documentation",
