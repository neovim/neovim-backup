The problem is that `vim.g` route might become confusing for newcomers, as it requires specific time before loading plugin to set them (I've personally been there).\r\n\r\nThe combined `setup()` is a reasonable and a common design choice specifically for mentioned conditions (enable only part of plugin, like single module, and customize initialization). Plus it can have more user-friendly behavior of typo validation (which is mentioned in `*lua-plugin-config*`), but I didn't want to include that to not appear as biased.",
