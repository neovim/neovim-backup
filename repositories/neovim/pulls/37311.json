    "body": "**NOTE**: This was created using claude code opus 4.5. I laid out my issue and it was able to find and fix the issue for me. I manually reviewed and tested this on my typescript projects using vtsls and it seems work correctly.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's the guidelines for using ai on the codebase so let me know if this is not appropriate and I'll close it :)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen an LSP server supports `semanticTokens/range` (like vtsls for TypeScript), scrolling triggers range requests for the visible area. The current implementation clears ALL semantic token highlights in the buffer before applying new ones, causing a visible \"blink\" even though only the visible range changed.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly noticeable when scrolling through large files - the semantic highlighting briefly disappears and reappears after every scroll, which is jarring.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nFor range requests, only clear and re-apply highlights within the requested range, preserving highlights outside the visible area. This is done by:\r\n\r\n1. **Tracking whether a request was a range request** - Added `range` field to `STActiveRequest` and `cleared_range` to `STCurrentResult`\r\n2. **Merging new highlights with existing ones** - For range requests, filter out old highlights within the range and merge with new highlights, instead of replacing all highlights\r\n3. **Clearing only extmarks within the requested range** - In `on_win`, use range-specific `nvim_buf_clear_namespace` call instead of clearing the entire namespace\r\n\r\nFor full/delta requests (when document content changes), the behavior remains unchanged - all highlights are cleared and replaced.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested with vtsls (TypeScript LSP that supports `semanticTokens/range`) on large TypeScript files. Scrolling no longer causes the semantic highlights to blink.",

The idea behind this PR is right (merge previous highlights with ones from the newly requested range) but this solution still performs a lot of work outside the 5ms-bound coroutine and mixes logic for what tokens still need to be applied in two places (like the decorator where logic like this shouldn't really be). Iterating all other previously-processed tokens (non-visible) plus the sort at the end could be prohibitive depending on how many tokens have been previously processed.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple range requests fired for the same document version, this will end up processing all of them and likely do the clear/merge/sort unnecessarily for the ranges that no longer match the current visible region.",
