But basically, without waiting for software to implement escapes, I just reset it on every prompt. It's been a while since I stopped using Tmux, so I have no idea what's the right escape seq in your case. For my basic Alacritty setup, I do:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n__ps1() {\r\n    # this is your typical PS1\r\n    PS1=\"$title$__ps1_vspace$jobs$dir$git$venv\\n$symbol$style\"\r\n    # this is the cursor shape reset\r\n    # (don't ask me about the sequence, I have fish brain)\r\n    # better ask AI\r\n    echo -e -n \"\\\\x1b[0 q\"\r\n}\r\nPROMPT_COMMAND=__ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is for Bash, of course. Your shell may have a different way to handle the prompt. If you find the correct sequence for your terminal and for Tmux, every time you quit a program, your cursor shape will reset. You can also check the `$TERM` and (I believe) `$TMUX` to switch between sequences if that's needed.",
