The solution is just to parse a language's self-injections after all other injections, which prevents what looks like some infinite recursion issues.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why it was the async parsing that caused this issue to present itself, I would think that it would have been a problem even with synchronous parsing :thinking: Maybe the issue is nonexistent when running only on a single pass (event loop iteration) somehow\r\n\r\nNOTE: A separate issue was discussed where `:q` hangs, which is due to the fact that it will always wait until an async function completes and the callback is run. That is a separate issue, but shouldn't matter unless there are async functions that will run indefinitely. ",
