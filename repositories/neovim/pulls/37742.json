But I thought I'd show where I'm trying to go, in case anyone else is interested. I'm not working super fast because I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to Neovim right now, so don't expect anything :)\r\n\r\nYou can see where it's at by creating `one_doc/`, putting `usr_01.txt` in it, running `nvim -V1 -es --clean +\"lua require('src.gen.gen_help_html').gen('./one_doc', './pdf_docs')\" +q` and then `cd pdf_docs` and `pdflatex usr_01.tex`.\r\n\r\nThat'll generate a `usr_01.pdf` that looks something like\r\n<img width=\"1676\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc9a2533-6383-4b76-ab54-21f564b54730\" />\r\n\r\nBasically taking `gen_help_html.lua` as a base. Eventually I'd like to keep as much as possible in common, and only duplicate `gen_one()` and `visit_node()`. Right now I'm not worrying about that - here's the rough plan:\r\n* in `visit_node()`, finish translating the different nodes into LaTeX that makes sense and results in a pretty `usr_01.pdf`\r\n* do the same thing for the entire user manual\r\n* extract that functionality so that we can have something like `gen_help_html.lua` and `gen_help_latex.lua` side by side, sharing as much code as possible\r\n* Remove/adapt some sections in the LaTeX output specifically (the \"jumping around\" section doesn't make sense, for example)\r\n\r\nMy overall goal is to generate an output that stands on its own as an eBook (or as a real book!).",

Ideally, avoid huge changes since those will take longer to validate.\r\n\r\nYes right now I'm just validating that the PDF output is possible/looks good.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to change the file as little as possible, just adding some sort of `output` param. But `gen_one()` and `visit_node()` are very fitted to a particular output, so they'll need to have one version per output.\r\n\r\nThe first real code review might just be that \"adding a pdf mode\" logic, without the implementation of the PDF-specific methods (which will be fairly big and probably generate some review comments)\r\n\r\n> Just want to mention [Typst](https://typst.app/) here as it works really well as template for data files (yaml, json and the like). This means that stuff like src/nvim/options.lua is ridiculously easy to generate PDFs from, using a combination of vim.json and and a simple vim.system call to typst..\r\n\r\nOh, interesting. I'd never heard of it. I'm not particularly married to LaTeX; it's just something very standard that I know can generate nice PDFs and that other people know as well. It's been around a long time, so it shouldn't disappear any time soon and its syntax isn't expected to change significantly. Being under 3 years old, Typst doesn't offer the same guarantees. But I'm curious and I'll experiment.",
