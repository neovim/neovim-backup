    "body": "Fixes #20907.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the ideal fix. Here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `:h vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf` states:\r\n\r\n> Sets the current buffer in a window, **without side effects**\r\n\r\nIf I understand this correctly, \"without side effects\" means that it doesn't cause the cursor to enter the buffer and therefore shouldn't trigger autocommands.\r\n\r\nHowever, the underlying implementation, [`win_set_buf`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/f3ee2440c781e978777d9369a96d1ae32e12eb8f/src/nvim/window.c?plain=1#L751), does trigger autocommands.\r\nAnd this appears to be intentional, with functions like `nvim_open_win` relying on this behaviour:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/f3ee2440c781e978777d9369a96d1ae32e12eb8f/src/nvim/api/win_config.c?plain=1#L323-L330\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/f3ee2440c781e978777d9369a96d1ae32e12eb8f/test/functional/api/window_spec.lua?plain=1#L2094-L2102\r\n\r\nSo my proposed hotfix is to wrap the `win_set_buf()` call in `block_autocmds()` and `unblock_autocmds()` calls in `nvim_win_set_buf`.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is an ideal solution. Probably, `win_set_buf` shouldn't be triggering autocmd events, but changing that seems too risky; see also:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14531",

However, [its commit](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/1def3d1542d6a65f057e743faea39a760b50db87) describes a rather confusing interpretation of \"without side-effects\" to mean firing _more_ autocommands...\r\n\r\nNaturally, that broke many plugins at the time due to the extra side-effects, namely concerning `nvim_open_win` (which called `nvim_win_set_buf`), so #14531 temporarily reverted it for a few hours until `noautocmd` was added to `nvim_open_win` as a workaround in #14659.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the behaviour we have today makes the most sense and that the doc should be clearer about the minimized side-effects applying to switching the window (which aims to be mostly invisible), _not_ the buffer; the current behaviour is analogous to `nvim_win_call/win_execute + nvim_set_current_buf/:buffer`, which I think is fine.\r\n\r\nIdeally once `vim._with` is ready for public use it'll make it easier to block autocommands from Lua without needing to touch `:noautocmd` or `&eventignore`.",

Why do you think the current behaviour makes the most sense?\r\nAs a user, observing the behaviour of:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n:lua new_win = vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false, { split = 'left', win = 0, })\r\n:lua new_buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)\r\n:lua vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(new_win, new_buf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe cursor doesn't appear to jump to `new_win` (or `new_buf`). In order for me to be able to reason about autocommands being triggered, I need to know about the internal implementation detail of the temporary window switch and the `do_buffer(DOBUF_GOTO, ...)` that temporarily \"visits\" the buffer.\r\n\r\nIt's the same for `nvim_open_win`. The fact that there's a temporary \"visit\" of the buffer is hidden from the user.\r\n\r\nEdit: Here's another example of why this may be unintuitive from a plugin developer's or user's point of view:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"BufEnter\", { callback = function(ev) \r\n  print(\"BufEnter: \" .. ev.buf) \r\nend, })\r\nnew_win = vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false, { split = 'left', win = 0, })\r\nnew_buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)\r\nvim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(new_win, new_buf)\r\n-- prints \"BufEnter: <new_buf>\"\r\nvim.api.nvim_set_current_win(new_win)\r\n-- prints \"BufEnter: <new_buf>\" again\r\n```",

For example, like this PR, the following skips filetype detection, syntax highlighting, etc.:\r\n```vim\r\nnoautocmd call nvim_win_set_buf(0, bufadd(expand('$VIMRUNTIME/example_init.lua')))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, I understand the order of events can be janky, especially with missing `BufLeave`s, though it's not totally unique to `nvim_win_set_buf` (e.g: changing buffers in `win_execute`/`nvim_win_call`, or in `++nested` autocommands fired by code using `aucmd_prepbuf`, and who knows how many other places...)\r\n\r\nCould consider blocking `Enter`/`Leave` events (excluding `BufWin*`) only for non-current windows (like `nvim_open_win`), but in some cases even `BufEnter` autocommands are used to set up buffers in scripts... :pensive:\r\n\r\nA compromise to fix the mismatched events without blocking them _could_ even be to just make the window switching visible? (or only block the `Win*` events...)",

That sounds reasonable to me, if it's consistent with other functions. But I guess no matter how we change it, it'll break some plugins...\r\n\r\nHmm, there's one potential issue:\r\nThe condition for disabling Enter and Leave events in `nvim_open_win` is:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n// win_set_buf temporarily makes `wp` the curwin to set the buffer.\r\n// If not entering `wp`, block Enter and Leave events. (cringe)\r\nconst bool au_no_enter_leave = curwin != wp && !fconfig.noautocmd;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we move that into `win_set_buf`, `nvim_open_win` loses the `!fconfig.noautocmd` condition.\r\n`block_autocmds()` increments a different variable (`autocmd_blocked` vs. `autocmd_no_enter` + `autocmd_no_leave`), so maybe the `!fconfig.noautocmd` check is redundant? The `window_spec` passes without it...",
