This makes plugin summary in the confirmation buffer a bit more scarce (due to alignment), but the result is not terrible.\r\n- Use better URI scheme for confirmation buffer (as per [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34919#pullrequestreview-3302062883)). It is now `nvim://pack-update#<buf>` instead of `nvim-pack://<buf>/confirm-update`. The visibility of the buffer id in the tabline is not the best side effect of this approach, but this is not a major issue.\r\n\r\n    I decided to use `nvim://` scheme prefix as it is more ubiquitous (and may be a good idea to use throughout **all** Nvim-owned buffers).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is a demo of before (left) and after (right):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2877\" height=\"1764\" alt=\"vim-pack_confirm-changes\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a743a3c-8ba0-42c9-9160-3536c58cf0ec\" />",
