    "body": "Yesterday was trying to prevent the jumplist from being saved in the shada file, as I've been for ages experiencing what is basically #31890. I first tried to remove the `'` item from `'shada'`, as `:h shada-'` says \"Including this item also means that the jumplist and the changelist are stored in the shada file.\". But then I got an error because of \"This parameter must always be included when 'shada' is non-empty.\". Together these two sentences are confusing, and effectively mean that you can't prevent the jumplist and changelist from being stored in the shada file. I also tried `'0` which as expected stopped local marks from being saved, but not the jumplist.\r\n\r\nI took a look at the code and it seemed quite straighforward to fix the problem - just add a check to not call `shada_init_jumps` if `'0` is in `'shada'`.\r\n\r\nWhile testing I found and fixed three more issues with `shada_write`:\r\n- `/0` doesn't prevent saving the previous search and substitute patterns, directly contradicting `:h shada-/`\r\n- If there is no previous `:s` replacement string, a empty zero-timestamp shada item is stored \r\n- `f0` correctly prevents saving global marks, except for the `'0` mark which is always saved\r\n\r\nSo with this I can now use `'0` to stop storing the jumplist in the shada file. This works for me because I also don't care for storing marks, but I think it is a valid usecase to be able to store local marks (and `v:oldfiles`) but not the jumplist. Local marks are buffer-local and the jumplist is window-local (and the shada file also only stores the jumplist of the current window), so imo the jumplist should get its own `'shada'` item, `j` makes the most sense to me.\r\n\r\nFixes #33511\r\nFixes #31890\r\nRelated #5078",

            "body": "Also, `:h 'shada'` isn't particularly clear on how most of the options control what is saved and what is read from the shada file. From what I can tell, everything but the changelist, buffer list and global variables are always read from the shada file even if they are disabled in `'shada'`. In my case, to actually remove all the jump items from the shada file and stop them from being restored, I had to use `:wshada!`.\r\n\r\nI think the most reasonable way to handle this would be to save and restore everything \"symmetrically\" using `'shada'`, e.g. if `/0` is in `'shada'` then don't save or restore search history or search/sub patterns. But when merging into an existing shada file, everything in it should be preserved, so in this scenario the existing search history and search/sub patterns shouldn't be removed, unless you use `:wsh!`. Doing a merge this way allows for two instances to have different `'shada'` options without having them interfere with each other.",
