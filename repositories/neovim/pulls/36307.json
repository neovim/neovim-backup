Every hyperlink-like element was replaced by `\"$1\"` (where $1 is the original string showed in the hyperlink);\r\n2. Arrows `--->` were used in lines containing practice examples when no editing text is involved;\r\n3. Context on interactivity was minimally adapted when strictly needed, not to disrupt the original tutor's intent;\r\n4. Tests regarding the tutor file refactored to ensure the new syntax is not flagged as an error.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n\r\nThe tests were executed using the command `make functionaltest`, since the changes were limited to tutor-related files and were covered exclusively by the functional tests.\r\n\r\nAll ran tests succeeded, except for tests under `test/functional/terminal/`, which seem to be unrelated to the tutor files.\r\n\r\nIt's important to notice that tests regarding the tutor file were refactored to ensure the new syntax is not flagged as an error.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n- Before changes: \r\n<img width=\"1366\" height=\"728\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4a041a4-41ea-4cd1-9a8c-8a901d2fdad3\" />\r\n\r\n- After changes: \r\n<img width=\"1366\" height=\"725\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7da8fe7a-7b3c-4cb1-80f1-44daeac9db22\" />\r\n",
