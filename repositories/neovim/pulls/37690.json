But in any case the current documentation doesn't imply that these options are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n>This use case likely comes from trying to enable a feature for a single client/buffer in an autocmd, but that's usually unnecessary. Unless the intention is to prevent it from running on other supported buffers/clients, it will avoids enabling it on unsupported clients. It will not create redundant data or autocmds for those buffers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it's not strictly necessary is an implementation detail, but from the _interface_ it's not at all obvious that this is the case. These APIs are often called from an `LspAttach` autocommand which is scoped to a buffer and client id, so providing the same scope to any API calls is usually the reasonable thing to do (I don't want my autocommand to have side effects on other unrelated buffers or clients). @mfussenegger already made this point for me above:\r\n\r\n>partly because we also document that they can be called as part of an LspAttach autocmd handler and that's fired for each client and buffer - so it seems natural that you'd provide both bufnr and client_id and pass them along.",

When globally enabled via `enable(true)`, its actual behavior is consistent with such an autocmd. It would be good if it worked that way, but I think it's better not mention such use cases in the documentation unless there are specific requirements.\r\n\r\nHowever, if changing the interface to this would feel more natural, I am fine with that.

It also does not seem worth losing the ability to differentiate between global and buffer-local enablement by switching it to ANY syntax.\r\n\r\nBut isn't then the confusion mostly around the global case, and not about providing both client_id and bufnr filters?\r\n\r\n1. `is_enabled()` is either asking:\r\n    - Is enabled globally\r\n    - Is there any client enabled on any buffer\r\n2. `is_enabled({ bufnr = 1234 })` is either asking:\r\n    - Is it enabled globally for any client (implies it is active on 1234 too)\r\n    - Is any client enabled specifically on bufnr = 1234? (not counting global)\r\n3. `is_enabled({ client_id = 1 })` is either asking:\r\n    - Is client 1 enabled globally\r\n    - Is client 1 enabled on any buffer\r\n4. `is_enabled({ client_id = 1, bufnr = 1234 })` is either asking:\r\n    - Is client 1 enabled globally (it implies it is active on 1234 too)\r\n    - Is client 1 enabled specifically on bufnr = 1234 but not global\r\n",

The result will be true regardless of whether it is enabled globally, specifically for client 1, or specifically for the buffer. This type of minimal-scope query is beneficial as an API for other plugins, whereas the other three queries are more suitable for user-defined interactions.\n\nTherefore, the current syntax implies 'ALL'—meaning it returns true only when enabled within a scope that fully matches the query scope. Enabling a larger scope will always cause a smaller scope's is_enabled to return true; conversely, enabling a smaller scope does not cause a larger scope's is_enabled to return true. I believe this behavior is consistent.\n",
