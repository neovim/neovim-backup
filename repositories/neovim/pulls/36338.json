    "body": "Main goal of this PR is to make lockfile synchronize on its every read. TL;DR (more, much more details are in commit messages):\r\n\r\n- Synchronization is basically:\r\n    1. Install immediately all missing plugins with valid lock data.\r\n    2. Repair corrupted/missing lock data for properly installed plugins (like after manually deleted lockfile or timeout during install).\r\n    3. Remove unrepairable corrupted lock data and their plugins.\r\n\r\n    This makes `vim.pack` behave more robustly in presence of some unexpected (but somewhat reasonable) user behavior.\r\n\r\n    Step 1 also improves usability in case there are lazy loaded plugins that are rarely loaded (like on `FileType` event, for example). Previously it would install it on rare `vim.pack.add()` (while lockfile contains an entry). Now all plugins from the lockfile are installed at once and `vim.pack.add()` only loads it.\r\n\r\n- Synchronizing lockfile on its every read makes it work more robustly if other `vim.pack` functions are called without any `vim.pack.add()`.\r\n\r\n- Performance is (usually) slightly better now. With a single `vim.pack.add()` filled with 43 plugins benchmarking the same two steps (read lockfile and normalize plugin array):\r\n    - After PR:  ~550 ms\r\n    - Before PR: ~700 ms\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are also side effects that helped with lockfile sync (details are in commits):\r\n\r\n- Adjust how confirmation is done (see demo):\r\n    - Do not error if user chooses \"No\". It was too restrictive while the error will still be thrown if plugin is attempted to be used.\r\n    - List plugin names first followed by their sources (aligned). Mostly because the name can be not default, but also because plugin name is its main identifier in `vim.pack`.\r\n\r\n        No strong opinion, just think it looks nicer. Can be changed to show only non-default names (like ``https:///github/repo/plugin (as `my-plugin`)``).\r\n\r\n- Ensure plugin is not on disk if it is not *fully* installed, i.e. *both* `git clone` and `git checkout` are successful. The #36038 made plugin be \"partially installed\": on disk but not checked out. This results in complications with lockfile (revision can be `nil`). Now in such case (usually due to non existent `version`) the plugin will just be removed from disk, which also fixes the security issue of #36037.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447a74f9-1e73-47b0-adc8-23785bd35759\r\n\r\nThis shows:\r\n\r\n- Initial clean install without lockfile (two installations from two different `vim.pack.add()`).\r\n- Regeneration of the manually deleted lockfile.\r\n- Repair of badly manually edited lockfile entry.\r\n- Clean install *with* lockfile (single installation during lockfile sync).\r\n- Reaction to the user manually deleting plugin directory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #36162, fixes #36254 (by repairing after manually deleted or badly edited lockfile)\r\n\r\nFixes #36231 (by installing lockfile entries which are not yet on disk, forcing users to actually `vim.pack.del()` the plugin instead of manually deleting directory).\r\n\r\nFixes #36037 (by ensuring that not properly checked out plugin is immediately removed from disk)",

After restart those plugins that were installed before timeout were removed (due to having corrupted lockfile data). Now the installed plugins are used to repair corrupted lockfile.\r\n\r\n~~One thing I also noticed just now during testing is that lockfile can become out of sync due to timeout. But as this happens due to early error from `vim._async`, I currently don't see a good solution to this when it comes to explicit lockfile sync. Some ideas are:~~\r\n- ~~Write lockfile to disk after every successful install. Feels unnecessarily costly.~~\r\n- ~~Allow a \"repair\" route during synchronization: if lockfile entry is not proper and there is an installed plugin, try to \"repair\" it. This was my original idea for the synchronization, but the code logic felt too complex (as repair requires async path due to using Git). However, it was before \"partial checkout\" was dropped, so maybe it is worth revisiting.~~\r\n\r\n~~I think this might be reasonable to address in a follow up PR together with #36199.~~",
