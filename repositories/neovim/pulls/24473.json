It looks like you've bootstrapped \"Lua-defined docs\" for builtin.txt, which means we could actually use _that_ as the source-of-truth, to _generate_ builtin.txt. \r\n\r\nThat's out-of-scope for this PR, but I think we should consider going in that direction soon. Generally I see most of Vimscript, including most of Vim's new functions, as \"frozen\".

In practice that really just means moving our Lua definitions files into `runtime/`. The only remaining hesitation was that this makes the files a public API, but I don't think that should block us at this point. But ideally, we should (or did) structure the data in a way that avoids the need for major revisions in the future.",
