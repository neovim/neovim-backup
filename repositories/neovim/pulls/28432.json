    "body": "# Problem:\r\n\r\nThe `nvim_win_xx_ns` function family introduced in ba0370b1d718d473d0ef51c35d88b98ba220082b needs more bake-time. Currently it's narrowly defined for \"window\" scope only; but other scopes (\"buffer\") and features are likely in the future.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nRename the API with double-underscore to mark it as EXPERIMENTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Open questions\r\n\r\n- We could choose *either*:\r\n    - \"store scopes on namespaces\", or\r\n    - \"store namespaces on scopes (w:/b:/…)\"\r\n    - \"store namespaces as global-local option\" (requires [some work](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/25455#discussion_r1345851839))\r\n- Refactor to this interface:\r\n  ```\r\n    nvim_ns_add(\r\n      ns_id: number,\r\n      opts: {\r\n        win: number\r\n      }\r\n    ): { ok: boolean }\r\n\r\n    nvim_ns_get(\r\n      ns_id: number,\r\n      opts: {\r\n        win: number\r\n      }\r\n    ): { ids: number[] }\r\n\r\n    nvim_ns_del(\r\n      ns_id: number,\r\n      opts: {\r\n        win: number\r\n      }\r\n    ): { ok: boolean }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Closed questions\r\n\r\n- `nvim_get_hl_ns` was added in this cycle: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/47dbda97d2f40729733b1c0d1d13d914065af23c/src/nvim/api/vim.c#L202-L203\r\n    - is it still needed or could it be addressed by `nvim_ns_get` ?\r\n        - There is much more to \"unwind\" (`nvim_set_hl_ns, nvim_set_hl_ns_fast, nvim_get_hl_ns, nvim_win_set_hl_ns`), so  can leave `nvim_get_hl_ns` for now.\r\n\r\n# Reference\r\n\r\nI read https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27361#issuecomment-1956487066 : \r\n\r\n> As far as I can tell this PR by itself is mostly forward-compatible with this extended proposal. The only difference I think is if we want to \"mark\" each individual extmark as scoped, or as you say, mark the entire namespace as scoped and then need to opt-in to it in specific windows.\r\n> \r\n> `nvim_ns_add_tabpage_scope` would be a convenient short-hand for marking each individual window in that tab. convenient, but can be done as an addon. buffer-scoped would be mostly relevant for highlight namespaces, which we can consider but is separate work from this (and needs design discussion on its own. I have some other ideas how to rework those)\r\n\r\n- It sounds like it makes sense to model these functions similar to the `nvim_get_option_info2()` interface. In general, we should avoid adding new `nvim_win`/`nvim_buf`/etc functions, if the main difference between each of the functions is only what kind of scope (win/buf/etc) it has, because that creates 4x docs and functions for not much reason.\r\n- Returning boolean is probably a mistake, it closes the door on returning any other info in the future. We should usually return Dict.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @altermo @bfredl ",
