If deleting the buffer doesn't close the tabpage, doesn't that mean there is some other window in the tabpage that shouldn't be closed?\r\n\r\nIt is mostly the matter of taste. As the tabpage was created specifically for `vim.pack`, I'd expect that being done with it should close the tabpage no matter the splits. Probably because the expectation is that the splits are also related to the update.\r\n\r\nNot closing the tabpage explicitly indeed only seem to matter when there are split windows. And it is minus four lines of code.\r\n\r\n@justinmk, do you have any preference here?",

If deleting the buffer doesn't close the tabpage, doesn't that mean there is some other window in the tabpage that shouldn't be closed?\r\n\r\nThere is a behavior that doesn't fit this assumption, but I am not sure if it is intended or not. The tabpage is not closed if there are only scratch buffers available. For example with the following 'init.lua':\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n-- Make so that there is only scratch buffer\r\nlocal init_buf_id = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()\r\nvim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true))\r\nvim.api.nvim_buf_delete(init_buf_id, { force = true })\r\n\r\n-- Make a tabpage with another scratch buffer\r\n_G.new_scratch_tabpage = function()\r\n  vim.cmd.sbuffer({ vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true), mods = { tab = vim.fn.tabpagenr() } })\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting `:lua new_scratch_tabpage()` opens a new tabpage with a scratch buffer. The `:ls!` output is only two scratch buffers.\r\n\r\nExecuting in the new tabpage `vim.api.nvim_buf_delete(0, { force = true })` does not close the window/tabpage, but instead shows a newly created non-scratch buffer. Here is a demo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f6a3d1-8799-4d6c-94a4-5c710d513dd7\r\n\r\nIf there is already a non-scratch buffer available, then the window/tabpage do close. Without even showing that non-scratch buffer. Here is also a relevant part of `:h :bdelete`:\r\n\r\n> Any windows for this buffer are closed.  If buffer [N] is the current buffer, another buffer will be displayed instead.  This is the most recent entry in the jump list that points into a loaded buffer.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes me believe that this behavior is unintended. @zeertzjq, could you please confirm or deny this?",

With this 'init.lua' everything works as expected, although the `[No name]` buffer is not shown before or after deleting a scratch buffer:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true))\r\n\r\n-- Make a tabpage with another scratch buffer\r\n_G.new_scratch_tabpage = function()\r\n  vim.cmd.sbuffer({ vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true), mods = { tab = vim.fn.tabpagenr() } })\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57d13181-4a50-4064-ac46-a1f4ebf5dcbc\r\n\r\nIf this is an intended behavior (which I presume needs to be decided inside issue in vim/vim, right?), then I guess an explicit closing of the confirmation window/tabpage is needed after all. This situation (two scratch buffers) will be more or less common in the wild when doing `vim.pack.update()` from inside dashboard type of buffer just after starting Nvim.",
