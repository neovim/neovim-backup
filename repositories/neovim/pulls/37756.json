If deleting the buffer doesn't close the tabpage, doesn't that mean there is some other window in the tabpage that shouldn't be closed?\r\n\r\nIt is mostly the matter of taste. As the tabpage was created specifically for `vim.pack`, I'd expect that being done with it should close the tabpage no matter the splits. Probably because the expectation is that the splits are also related to the update.\r\n\r\nNot closing the tabpage explicitly indeed only seem to matter when there are split windows. And it is minus four lines of code.\r\n\r\n@justinmk, do you have any preference here?",
