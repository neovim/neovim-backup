This was mentioned in the code comments of #35990.\r\n\r\nTake writing the fibonacci as an example, when you type:\r\n```lua\r\nfunction fib|\r\n```\r\nNormally, the entire function body will appear afterward. However, you realize the suggested completion isn’t what you want, so you decide to finish it yourself and continue editing as\r\n```lua\r\nfunction fibonacci|\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile editing from `fib` to `fibonacci`, you'll notice that each keystroke causes the virtual text to appear and then disappear, even though the virtual text content is identical. The reason is that every keystroke requests new completions and discards the previous inline completion items. Because returning inline completions from servers takes time, the virtual text is cleared until the new completions arrive.\r\n",
