    "body": "This is an attempt [WIP] to refactor the `:help` system to be a simple Lua plugin.\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n- Hard to extend: recently there's been a lot of talk about changing the format for the help files, perhaps something like markdown, but ideally something that can leverage treesitter and be able to have language injection. \r\n    - Recently we needed a hack in [lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1512) to have a tag point to the server configurations since it's written in markdown.\r\n    - A lot of plugins nowdays are not shipping with help files and instead document on the README, something could be implemented after extracting the current functionality.\r\n- A lot of special handling of help buffers in many places of the codebase\r\n- Improves maintainability, I believe more people might be willing to improve it once it's in Lua.\r\n\r\nCurrent status:\r\n\r\nWhat's implemented is finding the tags in the tag files and scoring them according to how the current implementation does it, meaning getting the same results. This has been successful with one caveat:\r\n\r\nWhen two tags score are equal `table.sort` does not always return the same order (with the same input). This behavior is [documented](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-table.sort). So running a query like `:h z?` sometimes returns as a first match `z%` sometimes, other times `z.`, because they are scored the same.\r\n\r\nThis is only a minor inconvenience when using the 'wildcard' behavior of helptags, since it's when it encounters this very similar matches that are scored the same by the algorithm. The C implementation uses `qsort` which seems to always return the same order for the same input.\r\n\r\nThe current code alone is the tagsearching, which removes about 300 lines of code from [ex_cmds.c](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/76af219e3e481222e6fece34c7c022d6a58998e1/src/nvim/ex_cmds.c#L4937) and around 100 from [tag.c](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/76af219e3e481222e6fece34c7c022d6a58998e1/src/nvim/tag.c#L1549)\r\n\r\n**This is still a prove of concept**: will like comments from the maintainers, if this is not desired I'm happy leaving it as is.",

I'm not aware of any compelling argument for keeping it in C (other than maintaining Vim patches, but how often does the help system change these days?).\r\n\r\nWe already have quite a bit of built-in capability for tag searching and handling of tag files, even apart from the help system. Is it possible to leverage that functionality (e.g. `taglist()`) rather than re-inventing the wheel? I imagine that most of the benefits from making this extensible/customizable will come at the \"input/output\" layers (e.g. different input formats and different output displays), but the nuts and bolts of finding and parsing tags shouldn't change.",
