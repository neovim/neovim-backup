    "body": "Problem: Currently there is no way for `vim.pack` to load plugins from disk in a way that doesn't involve cloning.\r\n\r\nIt can be solved by putting plugins in a dedicated 'pack/*/opt' directory (either explicitly or via symlink) and loading them with `:packadd[!]`. But this splits plugin management into two ways, which for some people is very inconvenient.\r\n\r\nSupporting this can be useful for several scenarios:\r\n- Plugin is not a Git repo.\r\n- Plugin is under a development by the user. Outside of symlinking, it can be installed via `file://...` source, but it means having to deal with two copies of the plugin. One special subcase of this is contributing to a managed plugin that is currently being used. Which typically involves creating and cloning a fork on Git forge. It usually is cloned in the directory with the same name as the upstream, so it should be possible to load a plugin with the directory name already present in 'pack/core/opt'.\r\n\r\nSolution: Update `vim.pack.add()` to load plugins that point to an existing path on disk. In all cases it is assumed that plugin's management (i.e. install/update/delete) is done entirely outside of `vim.pack`, hence the naming of \"unmanaged\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nResolve #34765\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- I am not particularly fond of adding this functionality to `vim.pack`. I still think that resolving such cases manually (by explicitly putting or symlinking to a dedicated 'pack/mine/opt' package) is a good enough solution. But I promised to try to resolve this with `vim.pack`, so this is the attempt.\r\n\r\n- The term \"unmanaged plugin\" is the same as [used in 'junegunn/vim-plug'](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/blob/60dd7a5eaf3ec98287e82bc6c2e7f99f31951c04/doc/plug.txt#L154). I think it is more directly shows the intention behind its support. Plus using \"local\" in Lua code is problematic.\r\n\r\n    Plus I think it is more future friendly to have \"local plugin\" and \"unmanaged plugin\" be separate things. Maybe something like `version = false` in the future can be used to mark currently managed plugin as unmanaged. Although I personally don't really like the idea of unmanaged plugins in the first place.\r\n",

This saves a lot of extra code and the result is aligned with how managed plugins are added (like order in 'runtimepath', for example). The symlink is not permanent and is removed right after `:packadd`.\r\n\r\nA proper handling of plugins outside of `pack/*/opt` directories is to manually adjust 'runtimepath' and source all necessary scripts. It is doable, but going the `:packadd` route is simpler.\r\n\r\nThe custom `opts.load` is there specifically to allow full takeover over how loading is done. Performing `:packadd` based on a seemingly random directory (which is outside of `pack/*/opt`) is not a good idea in itself. Also note that symlink is done with some private (hopefully unique) name and exposing that to the `opts.load` is also not clean.",
