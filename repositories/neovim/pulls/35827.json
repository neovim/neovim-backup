    "body": "This PR adds initial lockfile support to `vim.pack`. Resolves #34776.\r\n\r\nTL;DR (more details are in commit messages):\r\n\r\n- Add tracking of relevant data via on disk file. It is located at '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/nvim-pack.lock' and is recommended to be put under version control (as the rest of the config).\r\n\r\n    The file is read exactly once during an active session (for performance) and is updated (both in memory and on disk) only when needed.\r\n\r\n- Update several functions to use lockfile internally:\r\n    - `get()` takes `version` of non-active plugin from lockfile.\r\n    - `get()` always returns plugin's `rev` regardless of `opts.info` (as it now doesn't need Git CLI call).\r\n    - `update()` now updates all plugins by default, even non-active (because their `version` is now known).\r\n\r\n- Prefer using revision from lockfile when installing a plugin, instead of pulling latest according to `version`. This seems to be the most expected side effect of present lockfile.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- **Important**. The lockfile name is 'nvim-pack.lock', which doesn't make it immediately obvious that it is a JSON file. It will be detected like one within Neovim, but not outside. Since the file needs to contain 'nvim-pack' and 'lock' somewhere in its name, I decided to go with current name. The alternative is 'nvim-pack-lock.json', but it might be too verbose. If it is deemed not, I'd rather go with it. So this requires executive decision.\r\n\r\n- The current implementation should work reliably when `vim.pack` is used as expected, but *might* be a bit brittle when it comes to unexpected situations. For example:\r\n\r\n    - Lockfile is manually edited or deleted entirely. It is explicitly documented to not do that. To further mitigate that, I plan to add `:checkhealth` support for lockfile also (#34777) which will contain suggestions on how to fix situations.\r\n    - There is an error in between state change and lockfile write. This doesn't seem likely based on the code, but not 100% sure.\r\n    - There are several Neovim instances that try to write to the same lockfile. Not sure how to mitigate this without much complications. I guess just saying \"please don't do that\" should be enough.\r\n\r\n- This PR does not contain all planned usages of lockfile data. I also plan to update `vim.pack.add()` to perform extra actions (#34771 and maybe ensuring installation of all plugins from lockfile), but those will probably require more discussions and this PR is already big enough.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Several hours after posting I realized that I made a demo and forgot to post here :facepalm: Here it is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58815610-16e4-4be0-a562-344953b61370",

Or if `.json` extension isn't essential `pack.lock` feels pretty clean.\r\n\r\nThe original chain of reasoning is as follows:\r\n- The plugin manager functions are put into `vim.pack` to have a nice \"`vim.pack.add` is a smarter `:packadd`\". It also has to be in `vim.xxx` namespace, as all Neovim's Lua functions go there.\r\n- It requires own names for buffer filetype and URI name prefix. The \"pack\" seems too expansive, the \"vim.pack\" implies that it comes from Vim, \"nvim.pack\" contains problematic dot. So \"nvim-pack\" it is for both for more consistency.\r\n- The log file is named \"nvim-pack.log\" also in favor of consistency with filetype and buffer names. Although I agree that 'nvim-' here might be redundant since it is placed in the Nvim specific directory.\r\n- So in favor of consistency, the lockfile is named 'nvim-pack.lock'.\r\n\r\nI am generally not really opposed to 'pack.lock' or 'pack-lock.json, but only if the log file is also renamed to 'pack.log'. Although inconsistency with filetype and buffer name is a bit annoying.",

The only difference is that it is managed automatically and not manually.\n\nStill seems like data to me. The same could be said about plugins added by vim pack. They also \"configure\" the editor. E.g. I don't really care about locking the (few) plugins that I have and just follow the main branch. This is already encoded in my configuration by not specifying a `version` to the specs. I don't \"configure\" Nvim to checkout exactly commit abcdef of pluginX. \n\n> Although true, designing the default lockfile location around the idea of bare Git repositories is a bit far fetched.\n\nThat was not my point. My point is that currently the design is based on the assumption that it is important to put the lock file under version control and that therefore the XDG config directory is a better fit, which I think is the wrong way to decide where such a file should live. \n\nAnyway, that was my 2c. As long as it's configurable (or can be disabled) I'm fine with it. [of course not necessary for the initial implementation]\n\nTo end on a more positive note, Thanks for `vim.pack` and your careful design decisions around it. I love it already and am glad to finally ditch the external package managers :)",
