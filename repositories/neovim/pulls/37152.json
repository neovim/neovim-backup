    "body": "Problem:\r\nTerminals should respond with the terminator (either BEL or ST) used in the query so that clients can reliably parse the responses. The `TermRequest` autocmd used to handle background color requests in the terminal does not have access to the original sequence terminator, so it always uses BEL. #37018\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdate vterm parsing to include the terminator type, then forward this data into the emitted `TermRequest` events for OSC/DCS/APC sequences. Update the foreground/background `TermRequest` callback to use the same terminator as the original request.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nI didn't add the terminator to the `TermResponse` event. However, I assume the `TermResponse` event doesn't care about the terminator because the sequence is already parsed. I also didn't update any of the functions in `src/nvim/vterm/state.c` that write out responses. It looked like those all pretty much used ST, and it would be a much larger set of changes. In that same file, there's also logic for 8 bit ST sequences, but from what I can tell, 8 bit doesn't really work (see `:h xterm-8bit`), so I didn't use the 8 bit ST at all.",

So we omitted the terminator to keep it consistent with TermResponse (where we really don’t care about the terminator). However, now fish is doing the opposite (only parsing ST and not BEL), though it looks like this has been fixed now. \r\n\r\n~~I dislike the inconsistency that including the terminator introduces between TermRequest and TermResponse but we may not have a choice. So that will need to be clearly documented.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: I see that you added the terminator as a separate field alongside the sequence. That’s a good decision and alleviates my concerns about the inconsistency I mentioned. ",
