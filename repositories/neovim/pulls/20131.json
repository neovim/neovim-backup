It is supported on every single platform we can think of, and provides UTF-8 handling by default.\r\n\r\n`hunspell` seems easier to include in our codebase, as it uses iconv, which we already include in out codebase.\r\n\r\nIn terms of performances, hunspell seems equivalent to vimspell when checking, and much faster when suggesting.\r\n\r\nOther alternatives:\r\n- `enchant`: requires `GLib`\r\n- `nuspell`: misses some things like `SpellRare` support, requires `ICU`.\r\n\r\n# Status\r\n- Hunspell itself and dictionnaries\r\n  - [x] Add `*.add` dictionnaries at runtime\r\n  - [ ] `spellfile` (a bit tricky, might require manual parsing of the file...)\r\n  - [ ] Add `spellpath` option for the list of paths to search for dictionnaries\r\n- Spellchecking functions\r\n  - [x] `spellsuggest()`\r\n  - [x] `spellbadword()`\r\n  - [x] `vim.spell.check()`\r\n- Spell mappings\r\n  - [x] `z=`\r\n  - [x] `zg`\r\n  - [x] `]s` `[s`\r\n  - [x] `zG`\r\n  - [ ] `zw`\r\n  - [x] `zW`\r\n- Spell commands\r\n  - [x] `spellgood`\r\n  - [x] `spellundo`\r\n  - [x] `spellinfo`\r\n  - [ ] `spellbad`\r\n  - [ ] others\r\n- Misc.:\r\n  - [x] `<C-X><C-S>`\r\n\r\nThings that are removed because handled by hunspell:\r\n- Suggestion options:\r\n  - `spellsuggest=double`\r\n- Sound-folding in general (and `soundfold()`)\r\n- `:mkspell`\r\n\r\nOther marginal improvements:\r\n- The internal wordlist is now stored in memory, instead of on-disk",

When discussing about integrating hunspell, it was said that we should keep backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nNot keeping support for legacy vim spellfiles would greatly simplify the code, and would maybe allow a deeper rework of the whole spellchecking codebase.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work would quite probably be more significant, but as your said, it would quite probably lower the maintenance burden a lot.\r\n\r\nThis point also has to be put in perspective with the first (C++ dependency). We could use the C-only API for hunspell, but writing our own wrapper for C++ APIs seems better as the C APIs are not really ideal (as an example, spellchecking in C++ allows to get details about the word being spellchecked, while that's not possible in C).\r\n\r\nWhile I get that this is a problem with regard to the amount of dependency this PR adds, I this that the overrall advantages are numerous:\r\n- Better performances\r\n- Better language support\r\n- Outsourcing dictionnaries / codebase management\r\n- Lowering the development barrier of entry with regard to spell features.",

A 83,594 word document is ~500ms though, which is a tad slow.\r\n\r\nThere is some added overhead from parsing and such, but that shouldn't be too much, and if hunspell-the-library can be fast enough, then I don't see why hunspell-the-CLI needs to be slow (there is probably something to win here).\r\n\r\n> If you want to try out this PR (or wait until it reaches mainline), comparing the results for English/Dutch will be valuable.\r\n\r\n`concencus` is `['consensus', 'con census', 'consents', 'concerns', 'concepts', 'consciences']` in Vim, and `['concurrences', 'concupiscence', 'concurrence', 'concussion']` with this PR (\"consensus\" what was intended, the Firefox suggestions are the same).\r\n\r\n`Helo` is `['Hello', 'Halo', 'Hell', 'Hole', 'Hero', 'Held']` in Vim, and `['He lo', 'He-lo', 'Hole', 'Help', 'Helot', 'Hello']` with this patch. \"Hello\" is the \"obvious\" suggestion, but it's listed as fifth in hunspell (Firefox here is even more hopeless and doesn't list \"Hello\" at all).\r\n\r\nThere are some other pathological use cases with Hunspell; the \"concencus\" is something that I happened to encounter this week so I remembered it. I've heard some other people complain about it over the years too. I don't know if there are knobs to tweak in Hunspell or if anything can be improved, but Hunspell in Firefox has been a major PITA for me for years. Vim, but also just entering the word in DuckDuckGo or Google (entering \"concencus\" there also corrects it to the intended \"consensus\"), are better spell checkers for English than Hunspell.\r\n\r\n**Edit 2022-09-30**: another one I got today: `dissapears`\r\n\r\n    :echo spellsuggest(expand('<cword>'))[:5]\r\n    Vim             → ['disappears', 'disappear', 'disrepairs', 'diapers', 'dis spears', 'dissevers']\r\n    Neovim/Hunspell → ['dispersal']\r\n\r\nThe only Firefox suggestion is `dissipaters`, which is different (maybe different Version? IIRC Firefox bundles it) but not very helpful.",

I'd mark that rare, so I know, when I'm editing a normal document including German words, that that might be (and likely is) a typo. But it wasn't in one document where that was the part of a quote (i.e. sic).\r\n\r\nAnother use case of the ability to add rare words is you can add words like `pubic` as rare. I've done that LOL as I rarely want to write `pubic`, it's a typo from `public`. Again, a rare word.\r\n\r\nYou can also import whole dictionaries as rare. I have all of `~/.local/share/nvim/plugged/medical-spell-files/spell/medical_en` marked rare as it includes many acronyms that are probably typos. ",
