    "body": "When nvim -es is specified, the user enters ex mode and we don't enable the terminal UI.  In the modern day, the user is typically using this for scripting, but this also serves an important functionality as an editor of last resort when the user finds themselves without a terminal. ex mode is fully functional even on dumb terminals or when the terminfo database is broken, and this can allow a user to recover their system.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's no reason that a user shouldn't be able to use this more interactively even if they do have a TTY.  This is not a common thing to want to do, but it should be possible.  There are some users who prefer an editor that does not take up the entire terminal, but may enjoy the flexibility and functionality of Neovim, so ex mode may be a good fit for them.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, though, Neovim breaks this use case by explicitly checking for a missing terminal before enabling input.  As a result, since we've enabled silent mode, we have no terminal UI to read data from and we don't read from standard input, so we just silently read nothing, and exit.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely not what the user wanted or what they asked for, and it's bizarre to make this work only when the user is missing a TTY, so let's just skip the TTY check altogether here so it works the same regardless.\r\n\r\nSkip the test assertions on Windows because there the terminal outputs extra escape sequences we don't want and don't control. However, on other operating systems, this test needs to verify that the output is exactly as specified and doesn't contain any escape sequences, since users specifically will not want colors or other text with -es.\r\n",

That allows us to simplify `nvim -es` and make its behavior more useful for scripts (e.g. by _not_ printing visual/UI elements, only script output; and by always print LF newlines instead of CRLF).\r\n\r\n`vim -es` works in Vim without a problem and I use it from time to time.  I'd also like to use it in Neovim with `nvim -es`, since I don't want to have to need to have both Neovim and Vim installed at the same time.  Note that `nvim -e` is not suitable here because that echos colours and takes over the entire screen and that may or may not be possible or desirable.\r\n\r\nI also just saw someone asking to use `ed` on StackOverflow because they wanted an editor that wasn't full-screen and I could have answered that question while also explaining that there are versions of `ex` that might be more functional.  That's what led me to make another attempt at this (the previous one was #16990) and finally figure out how to write a test (I think a suitable test I could use as a basis was introduced in that time).\r\n\r\nI'll note that `nvim --headless +\"norm! gQ\"` doesn't actually work now, so I can't tell you what might or might not work about that approach.  It's certainly less discoverable because `vi -e` is `ex` and `ex -s` has the behaviour many people are expecting across implementations (including the BSD `nvi`).  So in my view, it would be a disservice to people to use a different approach for Neovim when we know that it is commonly installed as `vi` on a variety of systems.",
