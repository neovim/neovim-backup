(enter as submit, shift+enter for newline)\r\n       Choosing shift enter for new line and enter as submit for now.\r\n- [x] Fix undo/redo (why doesn't it work?) (undo redo with partially modifiable buffer is complicated. I guess that's why it's disabled. What to do. a ton of edge cases. Particularly since under works in branches. Also buftype can be changed at any point) (undo/redo works up to last submit)\r\n- [x] dd on prompt line clears the prompt too (fix it) (Entering insert mode again adds back the prompt. cc works by default)\r\n- [x] o/O in normal mode doesn't work. it shoudl create a newline\r\n       - check nv_open in normal.c, open_line in change.c . basic editibility check won't be enough. Probably the undo redo and dd ar the same. One key issue is operators can work on multiple lines at a time. How to handle that when only part of buffer is editable. For example with O on prompt line should we all text below it one line down and put a line there at prompt?\r\n- [x] O at prompt location moves cursor to different line. figure out why. broken after switching to position tracking with mark for some reason. (fixed) (Although this blocks all mark updates during O operation at prompt line. Should be more granular? Is there a better way to do it other than adding a global flag?)\r\n- [x] a/i at prompt location creates a new prompt in a newline when user input to prompt is none (fixed)\r\n- [x] enter on normal mode submits the text should we retain this behavior? (Since we are keeping Enter as submit in insert too so keeping it as is makes sense)\r\n- [x] When buftype is set to prompt set the last submit location to end of buffer (done)\r\n- [x] Things like d5k doesn't work (it deletes non editable region) (broken on master too) (upon insert adds the prompt line. Was trying to block the edit. But got lost in `do_peding_operator()` . I've Tried adjusting the operator range. But doesn't seem to have effect. any suggestions?\r\n- [x] Backspace doesn't work sometimes in prompt buffer where it should (Can't seem to reproduce now, most likely fixed with other backspace issues)\r\n\r\ncloses #32420\r\ncloses #32661\r\n\r\n",

I can think of couple of alternatives\r\n\r\n1. Make <enter> submit the user input and shift+<enter> enters a new line in prompt buffer. With it we have a question. Multiline paste needs to work with this too, obviously. But it won't directly work as it does like this. Since the paste won't have shift+enter. Is pasting tracked somewhere? Is there a way to differentiate paste from userinput? particularly when done with `<C-r>` in input mode?\r\n2. Add a way to configure the submit button. set_prompt_submit_key(\"<cr>\") for example. The default being `<cr>` when `<cr>` is used is submit key prompt buffer retains all current behavior with all it's flaws. If the submit key is set to some other key, then the multi line functionalities work.\r\n3. Define e separate buftype for a multiline prompt buffer. separating it from the current prompt buffer behavior we have.\r\n\r\n2 and 3 basically make multi-line support opt-in. I guess some combination of these can also be done. What do you think?",

As a result, if the reg has multiple lines, it just submits the prompt. I think it makes sense to paste the reg completely like `p` is normal mode. For that, we need to insert `<S-CR>` in place of `<CR>`  here on the prompt buffers. Any idea how to do so? I had asked on the dev channel as well as justin on element but didn't get an answer. I thought you or bfredl would be the best person to ask on these stuff but didn't yet got around to it. I had left the comment as a marker so I can find the location later :]\r\n\r\nAlso another thing is do we want `<C-r>` to be raw input? In that case keeping the current behavior is fine.",

Things like range edits (like `d5k` in normal mode) can modify read-only portions of the buffer. The main issue is the read-only and writeable segments in the same buffer. Good part of neovim treats it as non-existent. Or broadly disables the feature to avoid facing it. Can you check the Notes section in the pr? And provide your opinion on those? I feel like achieving 100% regular buffer like editing experience will be complicated. But we can probably get to 90% of that without way there. I'm not sure how to deal with undo/redo yet, though.\r\n\r\nAlso, I looked at '[ , '] marks. They basically kind of do the same. They work by adding Pos_T variables (b_op_start,, b_op_end) to the file_buffer struct, like I'm adding the line number here. Then the mark system uses those values from the buffer to expose those positions as marks. Even if we go that route, we'll be adding an additional state. With marks, we can expose it to the user, but that takes away at least a key for the mark spot. I'm not sure if any special ones are still unused. Also, we can't directly overload '[/ '] marks. They kind of represent completely different thing from what we are trying to achieve here. \r\n\r\n",

It's doing what it's supposed to do. For example, say you are editing something in insert mode. Then went to different line edited that. The marks are keeping track of that. But that's not what we need we need the start of current prompt. Modifying the prompt is not one edit actions. There can be multiple as user switches between modes or applies some operator. The '[ mark will track only the last edit action not the whole prompt edit.\r\n\r\n> The callback may insert or remove text in the buffer before we lock in the submit location?\r\n\r\nThat question is resolved now. We track the last submit location after callback is done. So any modifications done in the callback would be tracked. What we are not tracking is edits through api. I think I should take a look at mark/extmark subsystem to see if we can leverage that to keep track of api edits.",

Our central task is to correctly set the \"prompt\" region, and we don't care what happens in the \"readonly\" region as long as the user editing UX isn't weird.\r\n\r\nYeah we don't want to block that. That basic chat behavior is already possible by modifying the buffer in submission callback. What's missing is is if some arbitary edit is done on read only part outside of the callback. Because that can break how last prompt submit is tracked. \r\n\r\nFor example, currently master. Prompt buffer submits last line all the time. Say user is modifying editing the prompt submission. At that moment some other running code appends to the buffer. Basically changing the location of last line. Now users old input is practically lost. Last line would get submitted to callback at enter. We are still suffering from that issue in the pr too. But in a different way. If some line get's added/removed in the readonly section (text above current prompt)  we will sent wrong lines in submission as our last submit position is wrong. This issue doesn't occur if edits are done in prompt submit callback as we expect changes to happen in that windows.\r\n\r\nSo basically even if we aren't blocking the ali edits in readonly we want to keep track of them. I'll checkout how extmarks track edits. I think having last submit location as extmark would be much more useful then just a LineNo.",

Keeps backward compatibility. `<CR>` just submits as before\r\n2. `<S-CR>` is always available for entering multiple lines on all prompt buffers. Plugins don't need to add explicit support.\r\n    if they don't want multiline text they can just map `<S-CR>` to `<NOP>`  `inoremap <S-CR> <NOP>`. It's also pretty simple to just split the input before processing in the callback\r\n3. If in some terminal, neovim can't detect `<S-CR>` prompt buffer still works. Although multiline won't work. At least, single-line inputs will be working. Technically, multiline can still be done with `o/O` in normal mode even in that case. On the other hand, if we map `<CR>` to `<S-CR>` and treat that as submit prompt buffers will be completely broken. As submitting won't work without `<S-CR>` being detected.\r\n4. If some plugin want's `<CR>` to add newline and `<S-CR>` to be submit. They can just remap the keys.\r\n```viml\r\n     inoremap <CR> <S-CR>\r\n     inoremap <S-CR> <CR>\r\n```\r\n\r\nParticularly, 2 and 3 are clear wins compared to the other approach, and we don't lose anything doing it this way.\r\n",

If we map `<CR>` to `<S-CR>` user/plugin will have to explicitly unmap this plugin to use multiline input and paste. Also even if we do that unless we also block out things like o/O too multiline input can still be made. And since the mapping can be unmapped from user side too so it's not exactly gurateed for plugins either that multiline input won't be there by default.\r\nIf we map use `<S-CR>` as new line after merge all prompt buffers from now on will have support for multiline input in same manner by default. Plugin/users don't need to change anything they just get a new feature from core.\r\nBasically if we keep multiline disabled by default it most of users/plugins won't enable it. Even if some do it'll just be inconsistant in users eye as in some prompts multiline would work and in some it won't. On the other hand if we keep it enabled by default most of the users/plugins will keep them enabled leading to more consistant multiline  experience.\r\n\r\nFor example I had written a [IRC client](https://github.com/shadmansaleh/irc.nvim) for neovim long long ago. The chat was basically implemented with prompt buffers. There's basically nothing need to change there with `<S-CR>` being newline. It's just a new feature in core that improves the plugin too. In this case that plugin is basically unmaintained. What I'm trying to say is if we keep it enabled by default even older plugins not following master will have the feature : ] \r\n\r\n> The reason that I suggested redefining the internal \"submit\" action to <s-enter> is so that we can avoid special handling of input that contains newlines.\r\n\r\nIt only matters for `<C-r>` in insert mode.

We can always define a (additional) default mapping or whatever if needed.\r\n\r\nYeah that extra mapping can be done on higher layer. We won't have to touch the c codes. I was mainly asking it to see if we need a better default. From the terminals I've tried kitty and wezterm can detect `<S-CR>` I've heard iterm supports it too (haven't tested). Alacrity can't detect it there's an open issue on their repo...\r\n",

We can see it in the master. Until 0.12 gets released, the behavior isn't fixed either way.\r\n\r\n> After the few minor comments above, this is probably ready to merge imo, though I might take a closer look at the tests later.\r\n\r\nDo take a look as you get time, and let me know if any change is needed or if you need any clarification. Also, do I need to get commitlint to pass? Doing squash merge should be enough, right?  If you want I can do a rebase and squash all the commits. for now I haven't squashed them, so you can easily check the changes made after your review.\r\n\r\n> We definitely want some way for plugins to easily ask \"what is the current prompt text\" without mucking around with getline(), marks, etc. Is that part of this PR?, if not can be a followup.\r\n\r\nIt's not there for now. Currently plugins can only get the prompt text when user submits. Though adding an api for that is not complex ( we just need to agree on a api signature/name :] ) . I can do it in a followup..\r\n",
