    "body": "`nvim_buf_set_lines` addresses the Vim8 out_io=\"buffer\" job-option.\nWith this change it also addresses the Vim8 out_modifiable job-option.\n\nInstead of jamming this into `nvim_buf_set_lines` it might be better to introduce a API function e.g. `nvim_set_options_atomic` which restores options at the end of the current request (which means it only is useful during `call_atomic`).\n\n```\ncall_atomic([['nvim_set_options_atomic', [\n    ['wrap', 0],\n    ['modifiable', 0],\n    ['readonly', 0]]],\n  ['nvim_buf_set_lines', ...]])\n```\n\nThe options would apply to global/window-local/buf-local/tab-local indiscriminately (unless there's a problem with that I have not thought of).\n\nIt may make sense to do _both_. This has raised a philosophical/design question: I noticed that the `nvim_foo_set_option` API functions operate invisibly, i.e. `:verbose set foo?` won't show what changed the option. \n\nIt makes sense, I think, that the API wouldn't care about `'modifiable'` and `'readonly'`: the API is lower-level than VimL. But the distinction has been blurred now that the API is callable by VimL. We can enhance `:verbose` so that API calls are associated with changed options.\n\nThe question of what to do about `nvim_buf_set_lines` is less clear. If plugins used this often, it could result in accidental edits, and it makes `'modifiable'` and `'readonly'` useless.\n",

While it still might be possible for other plugins or the user to get hold of this handle, this would still reduce the change that a plugin-owned buffer gets mutated by others by _mistake_. In most cases I would expect a plugin to to create a buffer, create this handle (by some API function), and set the buffer as read-only. A good-behaving plugin should never \"take ownership\" of an existing buffer in this way unless explicitly asked by the user.\n",

I don't suggest any involved \"ACLs/privilege management\" either. Just a single ownership/mutability flag is probably enough, and this would be associated purely with the handle, no keeping track of the identity of the plugin that owns the buffer or anything. For me the downside is more that the \"buffer number == buffer handle\" identity introduced by #4934 (so that object \"handles\" is purely an internal concept and users can just think in terms of vim buffer numbers/window ids) wouldn't be strictly true anymore.\n",

I'm just saying that a plugin randomly modifying a buffer set `nomodifiable` by _someone else_ should be very uncommon and even an anti-pattern (it renders `nomodifiable` completely meaningless, a user doing a single edit is not different from the user asking a plugin to make  some single edit operation) . This is very different from a plugin exclusively modifying a buffer because it some sense owns the buffer (it created the buffer for a purpose or was given ownership by the user), for instance an append-only output buffer, like `out_io=buffer`, or a buffer implementing a \"user interface\" for a plugin, which is a pattern which I think we  should support in some way.\n\nAnd while a separate mutable handle might not _necessarily_ be the best way, I don't think the cognitive overhead of _something like that_ is in the scale of an \"alternative universe\".\n",
