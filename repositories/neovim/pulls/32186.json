Setting it as background to either `Folded`, `CursorColumn`, or something else will make it invisible in floating windows.\r\n    - Grey2 is used for Normal. Setting it as background will make it invisible in normal windows.\r\n    - Grey3 is used for all other common UI elements: `CursorLine`, `CursorColumn`, `Folded`. Currently it is also used for `StatusLineNC`, but initially it was using Grey1. One of the reasons for this was *this specific issue* of not being the same to `CursorLine`, but it was deemed as bad usability and so Grey3 was chosen as the closest shade of Grey. See #26921.\r\n    - Grey4 is mostly reserved for `Visual` as it being different from `CursorLine` is pretty crucial for usability: it has to be more noticeable for easier visual selection. Besides, having `CursorLine` be lighter (in dark theme) will hurt accessibility via lower contrast ratio.\r\n\r\nSo with this in mind:\r\n- Changing `CursorLine` to Grey1 will make it invisible in floating windows. Navigating inside floating windows is most certainly a more common scenario than cursor being near statusline in inactive normal window and *probably* more common than it being near the fold.\r\n- Changing `Folded` to Grey4 is possible but I personally think that it makes folds be too visible, as Grey4 was *designed* to be more visible.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think it's better to close this PR. I'll also add this to #30612 with the intention of closing that one too.",

I think the current `Visual` could use much more contrast. And it sounds like that would also allow the use of Grey4 for something else.\r\n\r\n[1] I know I objected to \"reverse\" initially, but at this point I'd prefer it to the low-contrast `Visual`.

            "body": "> Would it help if we switched `Visual` to `gui=reverse`[1] ? I think the current `Visual` could use much more contrast. And it sounds like that would also allow the use of Grey4 for something else.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be much help. Mostly because the whole grey palette [was designed](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/851137f67905f6038e51b5b7d1490fbedea4faaa/runtime/doc/dev_theme.txt#L45-L47) around the concept of four lightness values for background with each level reserved for `NormalFloat`, `Normal`, `CursorLine`, and `Visual`. It basically means that Grey4 is designed to draw (mostly temporary) attention through background but still have reasonable contrast ratio with all foreground colors (4 shades of grey and six syntax colors). It is already used as background to serve that purpose where it needs to: `Visual`, `ColorColumn`, `DiffChange`, `MatchParen`. The `Folded` and `StatusLineNC` groups don't feel like they need to draw attention, but on the contrary need to indicate their presence without drawing attention (which is what Grey3 is designed for).\r\n\r\nAlthough the root issue from #30612 is unfortunate, there are other visual clues to distinguish lines:\r\n- Fold has special 'foldtext' to indicate fold, which usually and by default makes it clear that that is fold.\r\n- Inactive statusline when next to the cursor line in active window is always the one at the top.\r\n\r\n> [1] I know I objected to \"reverse\" initially, but at this point I'd prefer it to the low-contrast `Visual`. Actually I would prefer `Visual guifg=bg guibg=fg` but I assume that's too controversial.\r\n\r\nIf by \"low-contrast\" you mean contrast ratio between `Visual` and `Normal` background, then it is a respectable 2.3. Many most popular Neovim color schemes have significantly lower score. With this contrast even text is fairly readable, as can be seen with non-current Line numbers (as [`LineNr` uses DarkGrey4 for foreground](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/851137f67905f6038e51b5b7d1490fbedea4faaa/src/nvim/highlight_group.c#L447) with `Normal`'s DarkGrey2 as background). If you mean \"low-contrast\" as in \"text has low contrast inside Visual selection\", then it is a very good 6.1-6.3 for foreground colors and not-so-good 2.9 for comments (which should be okay as visual selection is temporary).\r\n\r\nUsing background-only `Visual` highlight group was one of the main constraints during default color scheme building, because users *mostly* prefer and expect having syntax highlighting present during visual selection, as this is how it is done in other editors. So using `guifg=bg guibg=fg` (or more realistically `guifg=NvimDarkGrey2 guibg=NvimLightGrey2` for dark background) doesn't achieve that, but indeed delivers better contrast ratio.\r\n\r\nUsing \"reverse\" half-achieves syntax color preservation, but in a very attention taxing way. I personally prefer \"reverse in selection\" in terminals when there are only 16 colors available, but not if more colors are available. And I don't think using \"reverse\" approach is what's more commonly expected for selection with 'termguicolors'.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe default color scheme was initially designed to be minimal, usable, and \"Neovim branded\". Being minimal mostly means using as few colors as possible (both in palette and its application to highlight groups) but being usable mostly means have as much visual feedback as possible. Striking a balance between the two so that on average a color scheme is a good *default* is hard, but I think the current design and palette fits it pretty decently. It can't be perfect in every way, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nIt also means that for each user it is likely that there will be *something* off, in which case the usual suggestion of \"configure it the way you like it\" feels appropriate here.",
