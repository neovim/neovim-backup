This was not enabled by default before because there were some concerns about performance. Servers can sometimes send a large number of diagnostics quite frequently, and sorting that entire table every time could add a large amount of overhead. Users who found that trade-off acceptable could opt in, but the default was to leave the diagnostics as they were sent by the server.\r\n\r\nAFAIK no actual benchmarking was done however, so I do not know how valid those performance concerns are. If you wanted to do that analysis and could show that the performance impact is negligible that would go a long way.",
