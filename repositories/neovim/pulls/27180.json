    "body": "### 1. Extra line break after leading whitespace.\r\n\r\nLinebreak should not be applied after leading whitespace (#25276). This issue was fixed by checking if the current virtual column is less than virtual column of the first non-breakat character. But the loop for computing this virtual column computes regular column instead of virtual column. Usually this still works, since most characters are 1 byte long and 1 cell wide, but tab can take multiple cells, and if it is not the last indentation character, then the calculated column will be smaller than the current virtual column, and linebreak would still be applied. The same issue can also happen inline virtual text is placed inside the leading whitespace, or if `breakindent` is enabled and leading spaces take more than one line on the screen.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/65824523/a011dfed-bf5f-4eac-9cc3-1013bfa40296)\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/65824523/48fb3563-a2dd-4699-b088-633d1f99e309)\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/65824523/aaf2477e-a751-49d1-89aa-a5a3fe3c3ffb)\r\n\r\nSolution: compare the computed column with the regular column of the current character.\r\n\r\n### 2. Inconsistent behavior for tabs\r\n\r\nThe code that checks if a line break should be created subtracts size of the current (`breakat`) character from the maximum virtual column (end of the current screen row) instead of adding it to the current virtual column. This doesn't work for tabs, since their width depends on the current virtual column.\r\n\r\nFor example, in [`Test_set_linebreak()`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/ae3eed53d6100598b6d26fe58e3e97541e03f3c1/test/old/testdir/test_listlbr.vim#L31), the `\\t` after 'hijklmn' stops at the end of the line (window width = 20, tabstop = 4), and in [`Test_breakindent20_list()`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8df7978fe31635ede12f6dae224e6a6c8f1ba882/test/old/testdir/test_breakindent.vim#L792), the space after 'no' also stops at the end of the line, but tab creates a line break, while the space doesn't.\r\nThis happens because both words are offset by one column (since the size of the space before them wasn't added), but tab increases its width by that size, while space doesn't.\r\n\r\nThe same also applies to [`Test_vartabs_linebreak()`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/ae3eed53d6100598b6d26fe58e3e97541e03f3c1/test/old/testdir/test_vartabs.vim#L286C6-L286C28). The third tab should have width 29 (30 from the third tabstop - width of 'x') and create a line break, but since the size of preceding tab wasn't added, it uses the same tabstop width, and its size is calculated to be 18 (20 from the second tabstop - 2 * width of 'x').\r\n\r\nSolution: add the size of the current character to the virtual column before starting to check for a line break.\r\n\r\nI didn't add `enum` for the values of `skip_next_linebreak` since I plan to remove it and either store the position of the next match, or just a bool if reinitialization for the same line could be removed.
