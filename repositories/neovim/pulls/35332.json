However ExternalProject_Add doesn't let us use the Cmake idiomatic way of setting include directories for a target via `target_include_directories`. \r\n\r\nI've had a look at at all the other instances of ExternalProject_Add across the codebase, none seem to include compiler flags in a way that is different to just `BUILD_COMMAND ... ${compiler_flags}`\r\n\r\nHaving a look at the `append_target_expression` function a bit more, it's hardcoded to the VERSION_STRING variable, I am happy to generalize it so it takes a variable as an argument to append to as well as a target to retrieve a property on because it's currently hardcoded to `nvim_bin` but it doesn't even really solve the broken unenclosed path problem because the `$<JOIN...` won't enclose the individual arguments in double quotes.\r\n\r\nWe could do the following for the DEPS_INCLUDE_FLAGS list:\r\n```cmake\r\nlist(TRANSFORM DEPS_INCLUDE_FLAGS PREPEND \"\\\"\")\r\nlist(TRANSFORM DEPS_INCLUDE_FLAGS APPEND \"\\\"\")\r\nSTRING(JOIN \" -I \" DEPS_WRAPPED_INCLUDE_FLAGS ${DEPS_INCLUDE_FLAGS})\r\n```\r\nBut its just extra code that doesn't do much more than just adding the individual \\\\\" entries.
