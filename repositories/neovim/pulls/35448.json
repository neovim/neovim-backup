    "body": "Separate repo for testing this plugin is here: https://github.com/deathbeam/difftool.nvim without requiring nvim rebuild\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nNeovim's built-in diff mode (nvim -d) does not support directory diffing\r\nas required by git difftool -d. This makes it difficult to compare\r\nentire directories, detect renames, and navigate changes efficiently\r\nwithin Neovim.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nAdd a DiffTool plugin and command that enables side-by-side diffing of\r\nfiles and directories in Neovim. The plugin supports rename detection,\r\nhighlights changes in the quickfix list, and provides a user command for\r\neasy invocation. This allows proper integration with git difftool -d for\r\ndirectory comparison.\r\n\r\nExample git config:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[diff]\r\n    tool = nvim_difftool\r\n\r\n[difftool \"nvim_difftool\"]\r\n    cmd = nvim -c \"DiffTool $LOCAL $REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample `git difftool -d master` result on this PR:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2544\" height=\"1431\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/599fea1f-bf18-4010-a9ac-f02e38aa5728\" />\r\n\r\nThe original implementation is mostly just grabbed from my code here: https://github.com/deathbeam/myplugins.nvim/blob/main/lua/myplugins/difftool.lua\r\n\r\nIm not sure if command plugin is best route to go for this or if there is even interest for something like this in core (imo it makes a lot of sense in core because git difftool -d is very useful and this removes the need for most external diff plugins with proper diffmode config and usage, at least for me).",

There are few things I could not find better solution for due to mostly quickfix api limitations:\r\n\r\n1. quickfix highlighting. This one is mostly minor issue as the autocommand for it is not too bad\r\n2. calling something when quickfix entry changes: this part is kinda annoying, as i have to use BufWinEnter instead and check if the bufnr is current qf diff entry, it would be much better if something like QuickFixEntryChanged autocmd existed or something in that style i guess\r\n\r\nOf course alternative to quickfix \"hacking\" is to just add custom handling for it but I did not wanted to invent new keybindings and workflow for navigating there and quickfix even with its limitations felt perfect to me.\r\n\r\nAlso for now it supports only 2-way diff with `$LOCAL $REMOTE`, I can probably try and support `$BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED` but its possible it would get quite messy, not sure. But if there is need for it its for sure doable, I just prefer 2 way diffs so I did not spent much effort to try and support more here",

I just tried it on 2 directories, and it has made Nvim hang since even before I sent the comment [feat(diff): add DiffTool plugin for file and directory comparison #35448 (comment)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/35448#discussion_r2296692340). Meanwhile `diff -r` still gives me result instantly. Unix has `diff` CLI tool for comparing file and directories, and it is extremely fast, so some way to use it as the provider would be nice. Or I wonder if there is a existing library for comparing directories?\r\n\r\nI bet this is caused by the file rename detection, which can definitely be optimized, my implementation is quite basic. Looking at some stuff, I can use `git diff --no-index --name-status` to do this in generic way using git, that is maybe way better.\r\n\r\nAlso for ignore, what do you mean by that one?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Please update the description (and commit message) as a Problem/Solution statement.\r\n> \r\n> I'm open to this (have been using the rather buggy https://github.com/will133/vim-dirdiff for a long time) but will wait for feedback from others.\r\n> \r\n> Can you publish it as a plugin so that people can try it out for awhile?\r\n\r\nI actually do have it published as a plugin here: https://github.com/deathbeam/myplugins.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#difftool\r\n\r\nAnd alright will update the description in abit",
