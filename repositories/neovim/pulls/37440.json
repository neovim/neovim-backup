To write her first screenplay, she also installs the `tree-sitter-fountain` package (for more information on the Fountain filetype, see https://fountain.io). She’s ready to start writing—no Lua plugins for .fountain documents required for this example.\r\n\r\nMaria doesn’t have a C compiler installed, nor does she know what one is, and she doesn’t want to be bothered with it. Her future fame in The West End awaits!\r\n\r\n## Background:\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes a mechanism enabling Neovim to automatically recognise and use system-wide pre-compiled Tree-sitter modules. For reference, see the list of available modules in the openSUSE Tree-sitter project (note, paradoxically tree-sitter-fountain isn’t yet packaged, although it exists on https://github.com/gboere/tree-sitter-fountain).\r\n\r\nIn openSUSE/Factory, these packages are installed universally for all consumers (including Neovim, Helix, and Emacs right now) in `/usr/lib64/tree_sitter/*.so`. This directory is symlinked to `/usr/share/nvim/runtime/parser`, meaning even built-in parsers for languages like C, Markdown, and Lua are provided by system-wide packages.\r\n\r\nHowever, this setup doesn’t currently work out-of-the-box with Neovim, as it doesn’t automatically recognize new parsers in the `parser/` directory. This Lua module resolves that issue by enabling automatic parser recognition.",

And queries are (necessarily) editor-specific, so these are part of our runtime and not able to be outsourced to system packages, just like syntax files. This implies that we _need_ to have full control over which parsers are used. This implies that parsers are also to be considered as part of our runtime and not to be shared with other editors (which may need a _different_ version -- or even parser if multiple forks exist).\r\n\r\nTL;DR: System-wide parsers are just asking for pain; no way are we going to support that.\r\n\r\n> This directory is symlinked to /usr/share/nvim/runtime/parser\r\n\r\n**openSUSE should not be doing this at all.** I cannot stress enough how bad of an idea that is.",
