Known problems\t\t\t\t\t*win32-problems*\n-\n-When doing file name completion, Vim also finds matches for the short file\n-name.  But Vim will still find and use the corresponding long file name.  For\n-example, if you have the long file name \"this_is_a_test\" with the short file\n-name \"this_i~1\", the command \":e *1\" will start editing \"this_is_a_test\".\n-\n-==============================================================================\n-2. Startup\t\t\t\t\t\t*win32-startup*\n-\n-Current directory\t\t\t\t\t*win32-curdir*\n-\n-If Vim is started with a single file name argument, and it has a full path\n-(starts with \"x:\\\"), Vim assumes it was started from the file explorer and\n-will set the current directory to where that file is.  To avoid this when\n-typing a command to start Vim, use a forward slash instead of a backslash.\n-Example: >\n-\n-\tvim c:\\text\\files\\foo.txt\n-\n-Will change to the \"C:\\text\\files\" directory. >\n-\n-\tvim c:/text\\files\\foo.txt\n-\n-Will use the current directory.\n-\n-\n-Term option\t\t\t\t\t\t*win32-term*\n-\n-The only kind of terminal type that the Win32 version of Vim understands is\n-\"win32\", which is built-in.  If you set 'term' to anything else, you will\n-probably get very strange behavior from Vim.  Therefore Vim does not obtain\n-the default value of 'term' from the environment variable \"TERM\".\n-\n-$PATH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*win32-PATH*\n-\n-The directory of the Vim executable is appended to $PATH.  This is mostly to\n-make \"!xxd\" work, as it is in the Tools menu.  And it also means that when\n-executable() returns 1 the executable can actually be executed.",

To avoid this when\n-typing a command to start Vim, use a forward slash instead of a backslash.\n-Example: >\n-\n-\tvim c:\\text\\files\\foo.txt\n-\n-Will change to the \"C:\\text\\files\" directory. >\n-\n-\tvim c:/text\\files\\foo.txt\n-\n-Will use the current directory.\n-\n-\n-Term option\t\t\t\t\t\t*win32-term*\n-\n-The only kind of terminal type that the Win32 version of Vim understands is\n-\"win32\", which is built-in.

And it also means that when\n-executable() returns 1 the executable can actually be executed.\n-\n-Quotes in file names\t\t\t\t\t*win32-quotes*\n-\n-Quotes inside a file name (or any other command line argument) can be escaped\n-with a backslash.  E.g. >\n-\tvim -c \"echo 'foo\\\"bar'\"\n-\n-Alternatively use three quotes to get one: >\n-\tvim -c \"echo 'foo\"\"\"bar'\"\n-\n-The quotation rules are:\n-\n-1. A `\"` starts quotation.\n-2. Another `\"` or `\"\"` ends quotation. If the quotation ends with `\"\"`, a `\"`\n-   is produced at the end of the quoted string.\n-\n-Examples, with [] around an argument:\n-        \"foo\"           -> [foo]\n-        \"foo\"\"          -> [foo\"]\n-        \"foo\"bar        -> [foobar]\n-        \"foo\" bar       -> [foo], [bar]\n-        \"foo\"\"bar       -> [foo\"bar]\n-        \"foo\"\" bar      -> [foo\"], [bar]\n-        \"foo\"\"\"bar\"     -> [foo\"bar]\n-\n-\n-==============================================================================\n-3. Using the mouse\t\t\t\t\t*win32-mouse*\n-\n-The Win32 version of Vim supports using the mouse.  If you have a two-button\n-mouse, the middle button can be emulated by pressing both left and right\n-buttons simultaneously - but note that in the Win32 GUI, if you have the right\n-mouse button pop-up menu enabled (see 'mouse'), you should err on the side of\n-pressing the left button first.\t\t\t\t|mouse-using|\n-\n-When the mouse doesn't work, try disabling the \"Quick Edit Mode\" feature of\n-the console.\n-\n-==============================================================================\n-4. Win32 mini FAQ\t\t\t\t\t*win32-faq*\n-\n-Q. How do I change the font?\n-A. In the GUI version, you can use the 'guifont' option.  Example: >\n-\t:set guifont=Lucida_Console:h15:cDEFAULT\n-<  In the console version, you need to set the font of the console itself.\n-   You cannot do this from within Vim.\n-\n-Q. I'm using Vim to edit a symbolically linked file on a Unix NFS file server.\n-   When I write the file, Vim does not \"write through\" the symlink.  Instead,\n-   it deletes the symbolic link and creates a new file in its place.  Why?\n-A. On Unix, Vim is prepared for links (symbolic or hard).  A backup copy of\n-   the original file is made and then the original file is overwritten.  This\n-   assures that all properties of the file remain the same.  On non-Unix\n-   systems, the original file is renamed and a new file is written.  Only the\n-   protection bits are set like the original file.  However, this doesn't work\n-   properly when working on an NFS-mounted file system where links and other\n-   things exist.  The only way to fix this in the current version is not\n-   making a backup file, by \":set nobackup nowritebackup\"     |'writebackup'|\n-\n-Q. I'm using Vim to edit a file on a Unix file server through Samba.  When I\n-   write the file, the owner of the file is changed.  Why?\n-A. When writing a file Vim renames the original file, this is a backup (in\n-   case writing the file fails halfway).  Then the file is written as a new\n-   file.  Samba then gives it the default owner for the file system, which may\n-   differ from the original owner.\n-   To avoid this set the 'backupcopy' option to \"yes\".  Vim will then make a\n-   copy of the file for the backup, and overwrite the original file.  The\n-   owner isn't changed then.\n-\n-Q. How do I get to see the output of \":make\" while it's running?\n-A. Basically what you need is to put a tee program that will copy its input\n-   (the output from make) to both stdout and to the errorfile.  You can find a\n-   copy of tee (and a number of other GNU tools) at\n-   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net or http://unxutils.sourceforge.net\n-   Alternatively, try the more recent Cygnus version of the GNU tools at\n-   http://www.cygwin.com  Other Unix-style tools for Win32 are listed at\n-   http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Unix/Win32/\n-   When you do get a copy of tee, you'll need to add >\n-\t:set shellpipe=\\|\\ tee\n-<  to your _vimrc.\n-\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*:!start*",
