    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nNeovim no longer ships with a tee binary on Windows, which breaks functionality for the :grep and :make commands.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nInclude a simple, no-dependency tee.c source file in the src/ directory. Update CMakeLists.txt to build a tee executable alongside neovim during the build process, and ensure the tee.exe program appears alongside the neovim executable in the bin/ directory so that it is accessible for :grep and :make.\r\n\r\nThe tee.c was obtained from the vim codebase [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/tee/tee.c). I ran a search of the strings in the tee binary that used to ship with neovim; strings that appeared in the binary show that this tee.c was very likely the source of that binary. I considered other available tee sources (see below), but felt that this was by far the most simple option for restoring the desired functionality. It builds without any required tinkering. \r\n\r\n### How to reproduce (before)\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\nnvim --clean\r\n:grep foo or :make, after setting a file to the makeprg option.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"887\" height=\"172\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-27 134646\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c633f58-f4bd-49c9-a89e-d9bd426d99be\" />\r\n\r\n### How to verify (after)\r\n\r\nnvim --clean\r\n:grep foo or :make, after setting a file to the makeprg option.\r\nVerify that :grep results and error output from a compiler appear in the message pane.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1813\" height=\"287\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-27 135006\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc3df38-df44-4e41-b966-a80fcbe4f4ad\" />\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis is a draft and I have not done any testing yet; would welcome any direction. At minimum, we should verify that tee is able to correctly pipe text back into neovim that displays properly in the quickfix list.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nOther tee options:\r\n- [tee-win32](https://github.com/dEajL3kA/tee-win32):  (this is MIT-licensed. However, I couldn't get it to build on my machine even after updating its makefile to call my install of MSVC. It's also super optimized and uses some processor intrinsics for multithreading. On the whole very impressive but not very portable, so not very suitable, I think.)\r\n\r\n- [gnu coreutils tee](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm): (Windows coreutils contains a tee.c. Last updated 2005. Did not build immediately on my machine; we'd have to determine which definitions from elsewhere in coreutils tee.c needs and incorporate them somehow.)\r\n\r\n- [WinTee](https://github.com/mpderbec/WinTee): (Has no license. Last updated 11 years ago. Relies on Visual Studio to build.)\r\n\r\n### Related discussions\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32431 (about the suspicious original tee binary)\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32504 (demonstration of broken tee functionality)\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\n- Testing\r\n- Update zig build file with tee.c instruction\r\n",

            "body": "@justinmk an update after taking some time to understand the testing framework. i'm going to address two things here: performance of the new tee.exe, and possible updates to [test\\functional\\ex_cmds\\grep_spec.lua](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/functional/ex_cmds/grep_spec.lua).\r\n\r\n### New tee performance\r\non huge inputs, the windows version of tee that we'd be adding here performs much worse than what test\\functional\\ex_cmds\\grep_spec.lua seems to want. this test greps the letter \"a\", recursively, on the test directory. on windows, it takes about 60 seconds with the new tee.exe. however, because the test only tries to determine whether large input causes :grep to hang, it still passes.\r\n\r\n(note: as far as i can tell, grep_spec.lua is the only test that specifically examines the process of executing a shell command and echoing its output back into the message pane, in a platform-agnostic way (for example, make_spec.lua only examines the behavior of powershell).)\r\n\r\ni ran some tests of my own just to better understand what's happening here. i ran the same \"a\" search with ripgrep with four configs that either use -uu, -uuu, and either do pipe to tee or don't. i tried the same test with both the new tee and the old tee binary that nvim still shipped with as of version 0.10.3. times were basically identical; here's a sample run:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"448\" height=\"1633\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b55f752e-3f16-4907-b905-fb781df93cfb\" />\r\n\r\ni timed it with rg and command prompt as a sanity check; times are almost the same. so this tee is slow on huge inputs. BUT in a typical use case for me, where it's echoing back a few dozen lines from the compiler at most, i notice no slowdown.\r\n\r\n### about grep_spec.lua\r\nif my interpretation is correct, currently grep_spec.lua doesn't run on windows builds because the test hardcodes grep itself, rather than referencing grepprg:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"378\" height=\"112\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea6c8b01-4460-4f63-8fc6-8346492a2444\" />\r\n\r\n[now that we look for rg and set it as grepprg if it's available by default](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/20b38677c22b0ff19ea54396c7718b5a8f410ed4), we should probably update grep_spec.lua to use grepprg.\r\n\r\nok i can see that as i write this, all builds are failing the test on the line\r\n\r\n`ok(eval('len(getqflist())') > 9000) -- IT'S OVER 9000!!1`\r\n\r\nmaybe the test dir that github runs this test in has fewer files than what i have on my machine...? (update: ok yes, it passes if we set the check on the quickfix list length to 100. this seems fine given that we're mainly wanting to see lines echoed to the message pane properly.)\r\n\r\n### anyway, conclusions\r\n\r\nmy view is that if we were fine with tee performance on windows before the tee binary was killed, then we will be fine with this version. for any typical use case, a user isn't likely to notice. \r\n\r\nhowever, grep_spec.lua should probably be updated to run with whatever is set as grepprg, if our goal is to test under a typical use case.\r\n\r\na final thread to consider re:testing: since we are now building tee instead of shipping a binary, maybe we want to check it built properly. to me, the simplest approach would just be adding a line to test_windows.yml.\r\n\r\n### still to do:\r\n- lint\r\n- update zig build file.",
