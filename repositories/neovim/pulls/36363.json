    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nNeovim no longer ships with a tee binary on Windows, which breaks functionality for the :grep and :make commands.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nInclude a simple, no-dependency tee.c source file in the src/ directory. Update CMakeLists.txt to build a tee executable alongside neovim during the build process, and ensure the tee.exe program appears alongside the neovim executable in the bin/ directory so that it is accessible for :grep and :make.\r\n\r\nThe tee.c was obtained from the vim codebase [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/tee/tee.c). I ran a search of the strings in the tee binary that used to ship with neovim; strings that appeared in the binary show that this tee.c was very likely the source of that binary. I considered other available tee sources (see below), but felt that this was by far the most simple option for restoring the desired functionality. It builds without any required tinkering. \r\n\r\n### How to reproduce (before)\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\nnvim --clean\r\n:grep foo or :make, after setting a file to the makeprg option.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"887\" height=\"172\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-27 134646\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c633f58-f4bd-49c9-a89e-d9bd426d99be\" />\r\n\r\n### How to verify (after)\r\n\r\nnvim --clean\r\n:grep foo or :make, after setting a file to the makeprg option.\r\nVerify that :grep results and error output from a compiler appear in the message pane.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1813\" height=\"287\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-27 135006\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc3df38-df44-4e41-b966-a80fcbe4f4ad\" />\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis is a draft and I have not done any testing yet; would welcome any direction. At minimum, we should verify that tee is able to correctly pipe text back into neovim that displays properly in the quickfix list.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nOther tee options:\r\n- [tee-win32](https://github.com/dEajL3kA/tee-win32):  (this is MIT-licensed. However, I couldn't get it to build on my machine even after updating its makefile to call my install of MSVC. It's also super optimized and uses some processor intrinsics for multithreading. On the whole very impressive but not very portable, so not very suitable, I think.)\r\n\r\n- [gnu coreutils tee](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm): (Windows coreutils contains a tee.c. Last updated 2005. Did not build immediately on my machine; we'd have to determine which definitions from elsewhere in coreutils tee.c needs and incorporate them somehow.)\r\n\r\n- [WinTee](https://github.com/mpderbec/WinTee): (Has no license. Last updated 11 years ago. Relies on Visual Studio to build.)\r\n\r\n### Related discussions\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32431 (about the suspicious original tee binary)\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32504 (demonstration of broken tee functionality)\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\n- Testing\r\n- Update zig build file with tee.c instruction\r\n",
