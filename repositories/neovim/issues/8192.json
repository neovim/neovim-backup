They dont do the awesome live preview like neovim does, and this plugin by default applies to the whole buffer instead of the current line, you have to visual select a line to make it more like the default.  The main problem is since it has bespoke behavior, one can't use it with `:cdo`. But a great plugin for those desiring the feature for now.\n\nA native solution would be far superior and I think very beneficial to the community.\n\nI like the proposed `k` for keep, its short, its on the home room, will be easy to use and remember.\n\n",
