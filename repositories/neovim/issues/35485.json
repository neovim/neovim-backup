    "body": "### Problem\n\nLLM completion often produces garbage suggestion (that is often big as well), however a part of such garbage could still be useful. So currently if I want to only accept a part of LLM suggestion, I have to either\n- Manually type that part\n- Accept the whole suggestion from LLM, then manually delete the parts I don't need\n\nBoth ways are troublesome, especially if the both the part I want and part I don't want are big\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nProbably extend the current `vim.lsp.inline_completion.get()` with an option `text`. `text` would be a function that receives a string as a parameter and returns a string. With it, I can implement [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)'s `<Plug>(copilot-accept-word)` and `<Plug>(copilot-accept-line)` something like this\n\n```lua\nvim.keymap.set(\"i\", \"<Plug>(copilot-accept-word)\", function()\n    vim.lsp.inline_completion.get {\n        text = function(s)\n            return vim.fn.matchstr(s, [[\\k\\+]])\n        end\n    }\nend)\nvim.keymap.set(\"i\", \"<Plug>(copilot-accept-line)\", function()\n    vim.lsp.inline_completion.get {\n        text = function(s)\n            return vim.fn.matchstr(s, [[^.*$]])\n        end\n    }\nend)\n```",

That matches how we use `format` in diagnostic options for changing the diagnostic message and filtering diagnostics.\n\nI once considered directly returning the modified item instead of leaving the operation fully to the user too, but:  \n1. When the insert text is modified, the corresponding range also needs to be updated, so this may not actually simplify things much.  \n2. The current range interface is still experimental. For example, we previously mentioned the need to flatten it. Therefore, it’s better not to require it as a return type, otherwise silent errors may occur unless we always add logic to indicate that this type has been modified.  \n\n> Shouldn't we make [the `accept` handler](https://github.com/ofseed/neovim/blob/e56469087b6436e73bceb8ef3ab11a1825e590d6/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/inline_completion.lua#L288) public so that users can invoke it after changing the item itself?\n\nPersonally, I support this approach. In fact, I had an even more detailed idea earlier. \n\nPreviously, we exposed the specific behavior of LSP requests to user customization through `vim.lsp.handler`. However, this method is not suitable for features that need to be enabled. As an alternative, we could add another table, for example `vim.lsp.callback` (just a placeholder name), to store the default table—here it would be `vim.lsp.callback.inline_completion.on_accept`.\n\nThis kind of interface design can also address the need for more customization. For instance, there was a previous request for customize inlay hints, such as showing them at the end of a line or truncating overly long hints. We could expose the inlay hint display logic as `vim.lsp.callbacks.inlay_hint.on_decorate`, allowing users to override `on_decorate` to modify the default behavior.",
