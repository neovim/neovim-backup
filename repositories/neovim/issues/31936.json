We can prove this by checking `:registers` output. But trying to paste from this registers results in pasting from `\"\"`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(`PATH=` used to avoid detecting clipboard provider. But better to also check manually that it is not set: `:checkhealth provider.clipboard`)\n\n```\necho -e 'aaa\\nbbb' | PATH= /bin/nvim --clean\n\"+yy\nj\nyy\n\"+p\n:registers\n```\n\nAt then end `:registers` shows that `\"+` contains `aaa` but we clearly see that when we did `\"+p`, it pasted content of `\"\"`, not `\"+`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n#### Solution 1\n\nMake `\"+` and `\"*` registers act as any other named register if clipboard provider not found. So it will write and read registers without falling back to `\"\"` as it does now.\n\n#### Solution 2\n\nPrevent creating (and writing to) registers `\"+` and `\"*` when clipboard provider not found. So, after `\"+yy`, doing `\"+p` should not paste anything.\n\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.3\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.1 (with +clipboard compiled feature)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\narchlinux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\npacman",
