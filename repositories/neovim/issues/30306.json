This recently became a problem after introduction of not configurable \"session only\" mappings for snippet navigation (see #30198).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSome way for users to configure how certain aspects of snippets expansion is done. As per [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30198#issuecomment-2336620609), it might be a good idea to define the scope before deciding on this.\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions:\r\n- Implement `vim.snippet.config()`, similar in spirit to `vim.diagnostic.config()`. Currently this seems like the best (future-proof, already familiar) design. See also [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30198#issuecomment-2336624245) for some counter-points.\r\n- Allow `opts` in `vim.snippet.expand()`. This allows configuration on a call level which might be good for plugins that leverage it. However, it also might be too granular to the point of not solving the issue for built-in functionality (see [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30198#issuecomment-2336583394)).\r\n- Implement `SnippetEnter` and `SnippetLeave` events (see #26449) for users to be able to perform actions only inside snippet session. Not *exactly* the snippet configuration, but at least *some* way for users to act on snippet expansion.\r\n\r\ncc @MariaSolOs, @mfussenegger, @clason",

There are global/local buffer/window options for most of the other configurations. `diagnostic.config` is the exception because it required namespace scoping. That's not required for snippets.\r\n- It would require a keymap DSL, which was already identified as sub-optimal in other issues/plugin guide PRs.\r\n\r\n> Allow opts in vim.snippet.expand(). This allows configuration on a call level which might be good for plugins that leverage it. However, it also might be too granular to the point of not solving the issue for built-in functionality (see this comment).\r\n\r\nMaybe I haven't been clear enough in the other issue. This is a no-go for me. I don't see us adding a `vim.completion.enable({ snippet_keymap =  })` _and_ a `vim.lsp.buf.code_action({ snippet_keymap = ... })` _and_ `vim.lsp.future_snippet_use_case...`\r\n\r\nBesides spreading the configuration to each function that triggers `vim.snippet.expand` under the hood, it also suffers from the keymap-DSL problem, unless we'd make it `on_snippet_start` triggers, but at that point we'd be emulating snippet autocmds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease let us not introduce new ways of doing things. \r\nThis should either be:\r\n\r\n- A global keybinding instead of context dependent that's set as default which users can override like other default keybindings.\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26449",
