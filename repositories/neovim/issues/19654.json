It seems that this is maybe possible using :ownsyntax, and then defining a new syntax for that window, but this seems incredibly complicated compared the wonderful neovim extmarks, which let me just specify the bounds of the region and the highlight group.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there does not seem to be any way of scoping visual aspects of an extmark (highlight, virtual text) to a particular window - everything about an extmark displays in all windows.\r\n\r\nIt would not be quite enough for my use case, but even :winhighlight seems to not work with extmarks. E.g.,\r\n\r\n`:lua vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('test'), 0, 1, {hl_group=\"Visual\", end_row=0, end_col=2})`\r\n\r\n`:set winhighlight=Visual:IncSearch`\r\n\r\nThis correctly makes actual visual mode look different in the current window, but does not affect the appearance of the extmark with visual group highlighting.\r\n",

And then reverted into \"EXPERIMENTAL\" API which is subject to no API contract. Hence the question about whether it is reasonable to also revert the status of this issue.\n\nIt is, probably, mostly driven by me not thinking that \"there is a private method that can be changed at any time\" is a valid reaction to a completed feature request.\n\n> If there is undocumented assumptions which cause practical problems for some usecases, it is better to open a new issue which clearly **spells out** these assumptions in a new OP, not to repurpose a solved issue into a unsolved one after the fact.\n\nIt is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. I don't think there will be any battle-tested usage until there is an exported method. And there doesn't seem to be a movement towards exporting the method until it \"matures\".\n\nI personally have at least three different plugins that would benefit from this, but investing that much effort into the very much unstable API is not inviting.\n\nNvim itself uses this in only one place (`vim.hl.on_yank`) for one and a half years. So it also doesn't look like it will be much tested with this.\n",
