I tried to find for an uncrustify executable but seems like the linking never completed ? (tried `fd -uL uncrustify` ) would like to log the commands at cmake_install.cmake.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nthis happens in a nix shell.\n```\n$ nix develop github:nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay\n$ rm -rf build CMakeCache.txt\n$ cmakeConfigurePhase # calls cmake with some nix settings\n$ make\n```\ndundargoc already gave it a spin and it was fine on darwin ? just not fine on linux.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI am ok with a hack like providing my own uncrustiy (nixpkgs provides one) but I suspect the whole deps thing is intertwined in the build system and I am not sure I can skip those. How would I call uncrustify bypassing the Makefile ?\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nmaster\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nnope\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nnixos unstable\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nkitty\n\n### Installation\n\nnixpkgs",
