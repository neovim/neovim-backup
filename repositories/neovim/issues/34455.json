I would like to select a completion manually (with `<C-y>` or something like `<Tab>` mapped to `<C-y>`). Initially I thought that I could just remap `<C-p>` and `<C-n>` to `<Up>` and `<Down>` when `vim.fn.pumvisible() == 1` but this is apparently impossible:\n\n- #9905.\n\nThere is also an equivalent vim issue:\n\n- https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/6440\n\nIn both cases, the issue reporter wanted to map `<C-p>` and `<C-n>` to `<Up>` and `<Down>`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWith something like this setting (I'm not attached to the name):\n\n```lua\nvim.opt.completeopt = { \"neverinsert\" }\n```\n\n`<C-p>` and `<C-n>` would behave like `<Up>` and `<Down>` in completion mode, meaning that they cycle through the completions but don't insert anything.\n\nPossible names for this setting:\n\n- `neverinsert`\n- `confirm`",
