    "body": "### Problem\n\nIn #18393, uniq is marked as \"Wanted\" (❕). I'm happy to give it a try if it's currently desired, but I’d like to know how closely the implementation should match existing behavior.\n\nAs in the command-line tool, uniq only removes consecutive duplicates. For example, to get unique elements regardless of order, you'd typically write something like uniq(sort([1, 2, 3, 1])). I've often messed this up myself by forgetting to sort first.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI think a function that returns the set of unique elements might be a better fit for the Lua side. If users want the same behavior as `uniq`, they can simply use `vim.fn.uniq`.\n\nA basic version can be easily implemented using vim.iter and Lua's table key uniqueness.\n\n```lua\nvim.tbl_keys(vim.iter({ 1, 2, 3, 1 }):fold({}, function (acc, v)\n  acc[v] = true\n  return acc\nend))\n```\n\nWould something like this belong in the Lua stdlib, or is it simple enough that users are expected to implement it themselves? \n\n\nEDIT: Current development: #35067.\n",

I've been gradually quantifying these unwanted behaviours in #28941. Though I think all of this problems can be avoided by using `vim.iter(ipairs(x))` and `vim.iter(pairs(x))`\n\nI also think too much is packed into `vim.iter`. Its generality is a strength, but I don't think it should be a canonical thing to use for common operations, e.g. `vim.list.uniq(x)` is much more ergonomic than `vim.iter(ipairs(x)):uniq:totable()`.",
