    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen setting up Neovim on a new machine or cloning a configuration with multiple plugins, users currently face a tedious confirmation process. Each plugin installation triggers an individual confirmation dialog requiring manual input, which becomes particularly frustrating when dealing with numerous plugins during initial setup.\n\nThe current confirmation dialog only provides binary choices:\n```\nThese plugins will be installed:\nhttps://github.com/user/plugin1\nhttps://github.com/user/plugin2\n\nProceed? [Y]es, [N]o\n```\n\nThis results in users having to repeatedly press 'y' for each plugin, creating unnecessary friction during the setup process. While the existing `confirm = false` option provides a global solution, there are scenarios where users might want session-scoped control without permanently disabling confirmations.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe confirmation dialog should include an additional \"Always\" option that allows users to skip future confirmations for the current session only. This provides a middle ground between individual confirmations and globally disabling them.\n\nThe enhanced dialog would appear as:\n```\nThese plugins will be installed:\nhttps://github.com/user/plugin1\nhttps://github.com/user/plugin2\n\nProceed? [Y]es, [N]o, [A]lways\n```\n\nWhen the user selects 'A' (Always):\n- The current batch of plugins would be installed\n- All subsequent `vim.pack.add()` calls in the same session would proceed without further confirmations\n- The preference would reset when Neovim restarts, making it session-scoped rather than permanent\n\nThis enhancement would complement the existing `confirm = false` option by providing both global and session-scoped control over plugin installation confirmations, improving the user experience during configuration setup and plugin management.",
