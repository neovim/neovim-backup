Currently, this limits how fancy we can render these filetypes; we have to choose between optimizing for editing instead of viewing.\n\n# Expected behavior\n\nIntroduce the concept of \"presentation mode\". This could be a simple flag or variable, which triggers filetype-specific handling.\n\n- Can be easily toggled. Suggested mapping: `z<tab>`, or `<backspace>`, or ...?\n    - Disable when entering insert-mode?\n- Filetype-specific handling:\n    - `text`: flow layout (\"un-hardwrap\": force hardwrapped text to soft-wrap)\n    - `markdown`: prettify headings/URLs/lists, flow layout\n    - `help` (vimdoc): prettify headings, flow layout\n    - csv, tsv (tab-separated values)\n    - LSP buffers: toggle verbose diagnostics?\n- Plugins are also encouraged to handle this mode. E.g. slides\n- Set 'conceallevel' ?\n- Vim has a `'readonly'` flag and related `:view` command. We could use this to signal \"presentation mode\"?\n    - Problem: 'readonly' is buffer-local, whereas presentation mode is presumably window-local...",

I believe that writing such a feature in Lua would be well within my ability, but perhaps too small in scale for a proposal. \n\nI think changing the `conceallevel` should be one of the main effects and would likely be my main use of the mode. For toggling presentation mode I have no preference between a key binding and switching when entering insert mode -- adding options would probably be best. Particularly for file type based branching it could be better to have activating 'presentation mode' be a hook that a user can define custom behaviour for in their own config.\n\nI personally like hard wrapping and the idea that entering presentation mode would suddenly, in some cases, soft wrap text to 200 characters seems quite unappealing. Perhaps there could be a maximum length enforced, such as 80 or 100 characters, but then this may annoy those that like to hard wrap at lesser values -- such as 72 for a commit message. Of course per file type configuration would fix this.\n\nI think it could be cool if plugins could leverage this mode to allow for better presentation of information, and flexibility in that presentation, but I would advocate for creating a new flag rather than 'hijacking' an existing one. Particularly with the `'readonly'` flag this specifies something importantly different to a presentation mode and could cause confusion. Also having a `'presentation'` flag signals to a plugin that the version of `nvim` supports the features that they would then want to leverage. (Perhaps including a version number would be useful if there are plans to significantly expand this mode with new features).\n\nWith regards to the video sent by @schilkp and the particular example of compiling LaTeX (while a feature that I would like as well) it seems strange that a text editor would ship with, or depend on, a LaTeX compiler. Suggesting to me that this particular feature would be better suited to being a plugin rather than a part of the core program.\n\nImplementing #30889 as well would reconcile any issues of overly small project scope -- by dwarfing its previous complexity. Though this _is_ something that I would be interested in doing. I have seen but not read through all of #31399 so perhaps restarting that discussion would be the appropriate next step on this front. I will look into this further.\n\nAs far as the structure of [Google Summer of Code](summerofcode.withgoogle.com), organisation applications close on February 3rd. After which I would need to find a mentor and draft a proposal for this work. I was hoping that the Neovim project would be able to help me with this and I look forward to working with you!\n",

I just thought it would be cool if there was a  system-level notion of \"presentation mode\" vs \"edit mode\" that could be used to control all such preview plugins. ",
