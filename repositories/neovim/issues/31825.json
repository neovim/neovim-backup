Currently, this limits how fancy we can render these filetypes; we have to choose between optimizing for editing instead of viewing.\n\n# Expected behavior\n\nIntroduce the concept of \"presentation mode\". This could be a simple flag or variable, which triggers filetype-specific handling.\n\n- Can be easily toggled. Suggested mapping: `z<tab>`, or `<backspace>`, or ...?\n    - Disable when entering insert-mode?\n- Filetype-specific handling:\n    - `text`: \"flow\" layout (soft-wrap)\n    - `markdown`: prettify headings/URLs/lists, \"flow\" layout (soft-wrap)\n    - `help` (vimdoc): prettify headings, \"flow\" layout (soft-wrap)\n    - csv, tsv (tab-separated values)\n    - LSP buffers: toggle verbose diagnostics?\n- Plugins are also encouraged to handle this mode. E.g. slides\n- Set 'conceallevel' ?\n- Vim has a `'readonly'` flag and related `:view` command. We could use this to signal \"presentation mode\"?\n    - Problem: 'readonly' is buffer-local, whereas presentation mode is presumably window-local...",
