Inserting a Markdown link\n- Similar related problems noticed under unpredictable conditions\n    - E.g. Whole split flashing on undo\n- Both in \n    - Neovide\n    - TUI\n- Never observed in 0.10.4\n- Might happen only in filetypes that have concealing\n    - Observed in\n        - Markdown\n        - JSON\n            - Lesser extent\n    - Not observed in\n        - Clojure\n        - Fennel\n        - Lua\n        - Rust\n- Degrades as a function of structure complexity\n    - More lines\n    - More nested nodes\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/765d7fed-03d6-42cc-88c3-a2651aaf93f3\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Cannot be reproduced reliably\n    - Adding plugins back one by one in different combinations\n    - Creates unpredictable results\n    - E.g.\n        - Removing `dstein64/nvim-scrollview` from my whole setup helps a bit\n        - But attempting a repro with that plugin only does not create the issue\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo such flashy behavior was witnessed at all on 0.10.4 and any recent version.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nIrrelevant\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.3.2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niterm\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew ; also tried with binaries",
