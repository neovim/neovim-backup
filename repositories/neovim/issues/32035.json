(we currently don't support that for inlay-hints, but for codelens we have `vim.lsp.codelens.run`. Some servers provide exactly this type of code lens for test cases (Run Test | Debug Test)\n> \n> This has me wonder if we either:\n> \n> - Could have a vim.lsp.server for vim help files, and provide the info as codelens and make it executable via `codelens.run()`\n> - Have a codelens abstraction sitting between virtual-text/lines and LSP\n> \n> \n> This would give users a more consistent interface and user experience in that if it looks like a code-lens it acts like a code lens. Same keymaps, same options to enable/disable.\n",

However, considering that inlay hints and code lenses contain different types of data, I felt that such an API might be a bit too forward-thinking, and I wasn’t sure whether it would meet the needs of LSP.\n\nBut now, it seems that at the very least, it can provide the support for “run g==”, so it’s worth a try.\n\nI think we could design an API similar to `vim.diagnostic`, perhaps called `vim.decoration`?",
