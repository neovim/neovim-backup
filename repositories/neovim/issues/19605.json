Then change '137' to the 0-indexed last line of the file (e.g. if it has 138 lines, line 137)\r\n\r\n`:lua vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, 1, 137, 0, { virt_lines = {{{ 'xyz', 'ErrorMsg' }}}} )`\r\n\r\nPress `G`. Note that the virtual text you've created above cannot be seen. \r\nPress `<Down>`. Note that the virtual text you've created above cannot be seen. \r\nPress `<Ctrl-D>`. Note that the virtual text you've created above cannot be seen. \r\nPress `<Ctrl-E>`. Note that the virtual text you've created above can *now* be seen. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt's debatable exactly what scrolling motions should show this text I think, but I would have expected it would be easier to see the virtual text below the last line. For some context, this issue was raised because of this issue on `lsp_lines`: https://todo.sr.ht/~whynothugo/lsp_lines.nvim/16. In that particular case, my code was triggering some diagnostics on the last line of my file, but for ages I could not work out why I could not see them.\r\n\r\nI would argue that if virtual text is present in the buffer, it's important to be able to see it. I don't think Ctrl-E/Ctrl-Y are commonly used ways of scrolling, yet they appear to be the only ways to show a diagnostic past the last line.\r\n\r\nIn my view, virtual lines *are* real lines - at least from the perspective of scrolling, so I would expect all the keymappings above to show them. I don't doubt this probably does complicate things, since in essence `<Down>` in this case would scroll the screen, but not move the line selected in the file. However, this seems like a reasonable thing to do in this case, where I'm at the end of the file and yet 'there is more'.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% certain everyone will agree this is a bug, but wanted to highlight this issue and see if there is a sensible way to address it.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nVirtual text cannot be seen as described above.",
