It adds ~2000 lines of C code touching over 20 files and its actually utility is quite questionable.\n\nCould we reconsider this?\n\nFirst of all It seems that he had provided a reasonable explanation hidden in the thread (I found it after clicking \"Load more\" under \"50 hidden items\"). I put it after my argument for better visibility since I support this feature.\n\nIn short, I totally respect your words regarding the maintenance. But still, I think that it can be helpful for neovim users who are still in favor of the concept of \"[bufferline](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#tabline)\". A common problem of those bufferlines is the \"squeezed tab pages\" problem, which also happened to modern browsers. Most browsers all ended up providing native support for organizing \"tabs\" vertically. So for me, it's worth it if the maintenance cost isn't a big issue.\n\nFinally, as a user, I'm happy with a simple function (~50 LOC) in my config to have a readable minimal [vertical tabline](https://github.com/vim/vim/discussions/17985). Surely, if the maintanence cost is too high, then I'm fine with any decision you'll make in the end. (or has it been made? Oops)\n\n> [link to the comment](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/17263#issuecomment-2857728160)\n> > Why does this have to be hard coded into vim? Why not a vimscript plugin?\n> \n> Potentially, you can already create a single window with all tab pages. There are several buffer-list plugins outside, that used this method before we had the `tabline` function. However, this has severe draw-backs, as this is essentially just a normal window that could (too) easily be edited by unintentionally, resized or closed by the user or may not getting updated automatically. Therefore, I think it makes sense to have TabPanel as a built-in C code available. Especially with typical wide monitors where you tend to have more horizontal space than vertical space.\n\n**Edit:** wording & grammar.",
