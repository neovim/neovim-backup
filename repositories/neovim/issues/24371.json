This helps ensure  that those globally installed module are locked to the version of Node.js they are installed it. Overall providing a really great and durable experience to users.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately today, neovim's Node.js provider hard-codes support for `npm` and `yarn`, which can be seen at: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/0a95549d66df63c06d775fcc329f7b63cbb46b2f/runtime/autoload/provider/node.vim#L50-L83\r\n\r\nTo be a good citizen [volta](https://volta.sh) follows this same pattern, and installs it's globally installed modules at `$HOME/.volta/shared`, which `neovim` does not yet currently detect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this results in machines managed by volta breaking neovim's Node.js provider. [Corresponding Volta Issue](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/866)\r\n\r\n## Question\r\n\r\nWould there be interest in a pull request, which adds `volta` as third mechanism of detecting a Node.js provider?\r\n\r\n# Workaround:\r\nThe following has `volta` behave as if it were `yarn`, which works with neovim, as it falls down the yarn code-path when detecting the node provider.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nvolta install yarn \r\nrm -rf $HOME/.config/yarn/global/\r\nmkdir -p $HOME/.config/yarn/global/\r\nln -s $HOME/.volta/tools/shared/ $HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules\r\n```\r\n\r\nyields a functional node.js provider for neovim.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n\r\n## Node.js provider (optional)\r\n  - INFO: Node.js: v14.15.0\r\n  - INFO: Neovim node.js host: /Users/spenner/.config/yarn/global//node_modules/neovim/bin/cli.js\r\n  - OK: Latest \"neovim\" npm/yarn package is installed: 4.9.0\r\n```",
