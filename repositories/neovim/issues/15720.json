Also its annoying to parse.\r\nThe best practice shell way is to use `${HOME}`, but it should be sufficient to mention that `$` will cover every continuous [0-9|a-z|A-Z] instead of eagerly (and unsafely) expanding like shells do to have the simpler `$HOME`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is also inconsistent with\r\n`:echo $HOME` returning both true in neovim and vim and `:echo ${HOME}` returning both an invalid expression.\r\nAnd `:echo ~` also returns an invalid expression for both.
