I don't want a statusbar (`laststatus=0`), nor a winbar(it takes extra lines like a statusbar), but at the same time at least the filename, the modified status and position in the file should be visible. So the only option is to set it in the ruler.\r\n\r\nProblem is when you have splits open, the ones that are not at the very bottom receive a statusbar. I fill that with dashes \"-\" to look like a vertical split or like `laststatus=3` looks - consistent. However that by design disables updates of the ruler. So I am left with no way to see info, besides things like `<c-g>` which is an unnecessary extra action.\r\nAlso when `rulerformat` is set, it duplicates at each split location, producing clutter.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be and option for the ruler to show/update info for each focused split, not just the ones without a statusbar, and it should be shown in only one place.\r\nOR\r\nThere should be `laststatus=4`, like 3 but without the statusbar and thus with a singular unified ruler.",
