(They aren't being rewritten with files, just look and behave like files.)\r\n```\r\n../\r\n.config/                       <- First level, the current directory\r\n| anthy/                       <- Second level, the directory inside of the current directory\r\n| | imported_words_default.d/  <- Third level, the directory inside of directory of the current directory,\r\n| | last-record2_default.utf8                                                     gets turned into a file\r\n| | lock-file_default\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what you get after Alt+Tab:\r\n\r\n```\r\n../\r\n.config/                       <- First level, the current directory\r\n| anthy/                       <- Second level, the directory inside of the current directory\r\n| | imported_words_default.d  <- Third level, the directory inside of directory of the current directory,\r\n| | last-record2_default.utf8                                      but looks like a file and doesn't open\r\n| | lock-file_default\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Netrw\r\n2. Open the tree view (press `i` multiple times)\r\n3. Open up directories (`Enter`) to get to the third level of nesting\r\n4. Alt+Tab, maybe a bunch of times, maybe quickly\r\n5. See how the folder turned into a file\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nLet the directories be themselves\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.9.2\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nyes, 2:9.0.1927-1.fc38 (not on DEFAULTS â€” there's no Netrw that way, but on the clean install)\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nFedora 38\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nGnome Console\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nDNF",
