Basically, the link at the bottom of any documentation page is probably broken as it has a few key=values in the URL query which are all ignored (because it redirects to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/new/choose). And I'm writing this issue under \"Bug Report\" template, which should be about Neovim (program) and not about documentation. So the \"Report documentation bug\" template should be added, because I can't create a blank issue.",
