I have to use `set cpo+=n` and `set showbreak=â†ª\\ \\ \\` to keep the character from overlapping with the text. This works ok as long as I have files < 4 digit lines. Then I need to add another space in `showbreak` which breaks it in places where line number is only 3 digits.\n### Expected behaviour\n\n![External](http://dailydotnettips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image8.png)\nThis is a configurable option in Visual Studio. It looks a little cleaner and doesn't make the user deal with the number of spaces in showbreak.\n**NOTE:** The glyph doesn't have to be drawn in the last column (but it would be great if it could).\n",

Vertical separator is done separately. \nAt every step, we store the characters & attributes to be drawn in `c_extra`/`p_extra` (showbreak goes here) OR we get a character from the line if we are in the step line-content. Then, we store the characters & attributes in `ScreenLines` (line [3857](https://github.com/romgrk/neovim/blob/a19b83ee9b3404de3dc981ab39ee0bb2f8edd406/src/nvim/screen.c#L3857))\n\n**Careful**: After the first `if` at line 2869, it skips (most of) the other `if`s until line 3857. That's a +1000 LOC jump. (Yes, this is insane.)\n\nIf you want more details drop a comment.\n",
