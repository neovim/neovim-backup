This obviously is painful to maintain because if an upstream project changes it may break our bundled-deps build when we bump our dependency version of that project.\r\n\r\nSome recommend [hunter](https://github.com/cpp-pm/hunter) for pulling in external projects with CMake.\r\n\r\n>  Hunter aims to be a full package manager, so it strives to build a project and all of its depedendencies recursively. This is fundamentally different than just adding one external project and ignoring the depedencies (what ExternalProject_Add does). The downside is this forces Hunter to maintain many forks of original repos just to keep track of the dependency information. \r\n\r\n[Quick introduction to Hunter](https://geokon-gh.github.io/hunterintro.html):\r\n\r\n> * **Dependencies are built at configuration time:** Hunter will download the source and build all your dependencies during configuration time.\r\n> * **Dependencies are built independently:** Each dependency is configured/built/installed independently and the only thing they inherit from the parent project is the toolchain file you passed in at the command line.\r\n> * **Dependencies share their own dependencies:** If two dependencies need zlib then Hunter will install just one zlib and link both dependencies to it\r\n\r\n# Evaluation\r\n\r\n### conan\r\n\r\n- conan is missing many of our deps (libtermkey, libuv at least)\r\n- fast to install on Arch Linux (Python package)\r\n\r\n### vcpkg \r\n\r\n- vcpkg appears to provide more deps, but still also misses libtermkey, libvterm at least.\r\n- slow to install (only vcpkg-git in Arch, requires to be built)\r\n\r\n### hunter\r\n\r\n- hunter does not need to be installed really (via CMake)\r\n- [min cmake version](https://hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/cmake.html)\r\n- also misses a lot of our deps, including LuaJIT: https://hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages.html\r\n\r\n### nix\r\n\r\n- ?",

Currently, we have the dependencies being built separately from the main application.  This allows packagers to skip the building of the dependencies and just use CMake to drive building the app directly (they'll ensure the system libraries are there and available).\r\n\r\nDoes going this route require that we use a Hunter-supplied version versus a system-supplied one?  That's probably the biggest issue that I can see.  Many of the packaging environments don't want you to download from places on the Internet--they want you to only use packaged libraries.  If Hunter requires that we use their version, that's a bit of a problem.  We could wrap `hunter_add_package()` in a conditional and maybe that helps as long as `libuv::uv` isn't a Hunter-specific name.\r\n\r\nAlso, forking repos things a bit tougher to manage our patches since they're out of the Neovim tree.",

Vcpkg is designed from the ground up to be truly embeddable -- it can function like a drop-in replacement for checking in all your dependency's code, without having to actually check in their code. We accomplish this with SHA512 hashes for all downloads, ensuring you truly get bit-for-bit identical inputs. If desired, the entire tool (and all dependency scripts) can be embedded in the neovim project via `git subtree` and there will be _no_ dependencies on the upstream vcpkg project.\r\n2. We take great pains to ensure compatibility with builtin CMake modules (and therefore with the system package managers like brew/apt). It is a goal of vcpkg to support projects that want to have the _option_ of bundling dependencies, but don't want to be locked away from supporting system package managers like brew/apt/pacman/etc.\r\n3. Native support for exporting prebuilt \"dependency archives\". Running `vcpkg export zlib --zip` produces a completely freestanding binary archive that can consumed exactly the same as a full vcpkg instance, providing the precise dependencies that are used in upstream CI builds and allowing developers to get started working on _neovim itself_ really quickly! This binary archive is host agnostic and could be attached to GitHub releases, your own website, bintrayer, or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'd love to chat more about what features you'd want out of a package manager via vcpkg@microsoft.com!\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "@ras0219-msft Thanks for reaching out, those features sound great. Besides the flexibility to support system-installed libs (2), the other major requirement for us is cross-platform support. Migrating to hunter or vcpkg for Neovim is a long-term goal so we will wait and see how things look a year from now.\r\n\r\n> I'd love to chat more about what features you'd want\r\n\r\nSimilar to (3), something I wonder about is the ability to bisect (build very old commits), even if the original URL for a dependency source is broken in the future. This is currently a weakness with our (and probably most projects) \"bundled\" builds.\r\n\r\nTo support this, I can imagine a \"snapshot\" feature which saves the source tree of all dependencies, which we can then commit to a some parallel repository. Then the build (`vcpkg`) could use that repository to get the sources of the dependencies instead of pulling from possibly dead URLs.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that we could always build old commits.\r\n\r\nI searched for \"bisect\" in https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg and didn't find any results so I wonder if this has been discussed. Maybe the answer is that vcpkg hosts forks/mirrors of all the dependencies (I think this is what hunter does)?  But it may still be useful for projects to have a single repository which contains the entire source of all dependencies, coupled with some tooling in `vcpkg` to easily support this.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?",

This means that a crude \"snapshot\" could be taken today by building your entire dependency graph once, then archive the entire `downloads\\` directory. This will include all the source archives, along with any needed runtime tools (msys2, perl, cmake, ninja, nasm, etc). It is our goal that no network access should be required during a rebuild and we actively patch out attempts by inner buildsystems to access the network.\r\n\r\nAn even simpler \"brute force\" approach would be to _check in_ the downloads directory in-place to a vcpkg fork, which would make bisecting trivial :).\r\n\r\n[1] There are a small number of `Microsoft/X` forks we pull from, however these aren't directly tied with vcpkg",

It has pretty good support for the core functionality (C/C++, custom_target, etc.) and limited modules support (the pkgconfig and fs modules) and is a viable solution for building many projects -- hopefully more, as people implement the remaining functionality.\r\n\r\nYou don't necessarily need to use the python-based reference implementation any more, so, depending on your use cases, that may make Meson become appealing again.",

It has 10 of our 12 dependencies (everything except libvterm and unibilium).\r\n- Surprisingly hassle-free. I was expecting more problems to get it working. It's pretty much plugin-and-play.\r\n- This will *probably* make it feasible to transition to a single cmake build setup rather than our two cmake build steps. I don't have solid evidence, I'm mostly going off that this doesn't have the FetchContent problem of only working with cmake and the ExternalProject problem of sucking.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Truly bizarre setup. You need to export an environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` that points to the vcpkg git repo. You also need to pass\r\n`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` when building cmake for some reason. I dunno, it caught me off guard that some parts are super polished and that some feel super hacky.\r\n- no dual-platform compiling as I understand it, so we won't be able to release dual-platform mac releases for both mac and intel, but need to release both separately.\r\n- Telemetry. You can turn it off, but meh. Why are they like this?\r\n- Will probably not work on toaster architectures like mipsel and sparc64. Could be considered an pro.\r\n\r\nI think, for better or worse, that vcpkg is probably the only really viable choice here. It's the only alternative I see that won't result in us putting in a lot of time trying to patch/upstream the packages. That or we drink the koolaid and rewrite neovim in a real language with a package manager.",

At least I didn't see a way to dual compile.\n\n- We basically need to add vcpkg as a submodule since the repo will be always needed. Whether this be with `git submodule` or some other way I don't know. Because of this most of CI/build system will require a significant overhaul. Aka this will probably require work and not be a cute drop-in replacement.\n\n- Losing support for a bunch of non-standard systems. I personally don't really care but I know some people care about this a lot. Apparently people don't like it when you say \"lmao who tf uses BSD in $CURRENT_YEAR?\".\n\n- Tangential note: this is a HUGE vendor lock-in, and probably something we shouldn't do lightly.\n\nAnyway, not saying we shouldn't do it or that it's not worth it, just that I don't think this is gonna be as easy as you make it.",
