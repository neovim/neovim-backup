For neovim, folding information must be cached.\n- `textDocument/inlayHint` and `textDocument/codeLens` require maintaining state for subsequent requests like `resolve`.\n- `textDocument/documentHighlight` could retain state to enable forward/backward navigation.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nImplement an internal-only module dedicated to handling these stateful data, by:\n\n- Creating `bufstate` and corresponding callback functions when a buffer has a client that supports the relevant methods.\n- Destroying `bufstate` and corresponding callback functions when no clients in the buffer support the relevant methods.\n\nUse this module for the methods mentioned above to avoid relying on nil-checks (which might mask bugs) and automatically creating tables via metatable methods (which can be difficult to debug).\n\nThe `bufstate` should only contain results directly obtained from the server (e.g., `lsp.foldingRange[]`, `lsp.InlayHint[]`) and derived information (e.g.,  computed caches or whether they are applied). It should not store user-managed settings (e.g., `enabled`).",

My familiarity with the code is not as high as that of the maintainers, so I am unsure if I have enough experience to address this issue, but I am willing to try it myself if others do not. Therefore, the roadmap I currently have is relatively low-risk:\n\n1. Refine the state management part in `_folding_range.lua` and extract state management into a separate module/function.\n2. Change the API of `codelens.lua` to be similar to `inlay_hint.lua`, that is, `vim.lsp.codelens.enable()`.\n\nI was already very interested in the goals above before my recent PRs, but it seems that they are currently blocked by the state management strategy. The priority for refactoring `inlay_hint.lua` is not high, as it should currently be a relatively stable API, and there is no compelling reason to refactor it at this time.\n\n> p.s. is https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/31454 related?\n\nI hadn't looked at `vim.lsp.diagnostic` in detail before, but it seems to be quite relevant. Interestingly, I mentioned in the chat that I experienced significant lag when modifying `vim.lsp.buf`, which seems to be the reason described in this issue. I can explore further, and if it is indeed related, I can solve them together.",

I dream of a way in the future to set something like\n\nMy personal recommendation is to implement a server with a backend based on tree-sitter, providing folding data through LSP (after all, it is an interface). I should have implemented basic support for multiple servers. This may not be closely related to the scope of this issue. I mainly want to find a reliable way to save the result of the LSP response (not only folding ranges but also inlay hints or code lenses) instead of handling it and immediately discarding it here.",

            "body": "Among all the implemented features that require state management (including semantic highlighting, diagnostics, inlay hints, and folding range), the model we use is that buffer data has client data to facilitate garbage collection when the buffer is deleted.\n\nHowever, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32247 indicates that there may be some client data in LSP that needs to persist even after the buffer is deleted. This makes me a bit worried about thoroughly addressing this issue based on the current model.\n\nFortunately, the issue reported in the above issue seems to be a flaw of LSP itself. I suspect it may be due to the fact that vscode's OOP model manages data primarily through the client class, which may lead them to adopt a strategy where client data owns buffer data. This ambiguous and flawed definition in LSP is very likely something they added as a private addition to directly describe vscode's erroneous behavior.\n\nLeave this comment as a reminder.",
