    "body": "While installing/testing neovim in a Windows 11 sandbox environment for security testing purposes before deploying in a commercial environment, the bundled tee.exe binary was classified as Trojan.Malware.300983.susgen. After doing my due diligence to rule out a false positive, I'm finding that this binary is exhibiting what I would consider suspicious behavior. Specifically, it is performing DNS lookups to fp2E7A.wpc.2BE4.phicdn.net and fp2e7a.wpc.phicdn.net, and making network connections to the following IPs with one of which being flagged as malicious (confirmed by VirusTotal, https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/950eea4e17fa3a7e89fa2c55374037b5797b3f1a54fea1304634884ab42ec14d/relations):\n\nUDP a83f:8110:0:0:700:700:2800:4000:53\nTCP 20.99.184.37:443\nTCP 20.99.133.109:443\nTCP 23.216.147.64:443 (potentially malicious)\nTCP 20.99.186.246:443\nTCP 192.229.211.108:80\nUDP a83f:8110:8d88:ffff:3083:de03:8d88:ffff:53\nTCP 151.101.22.172:80\nTCP 23.192.210.9:443 (res.public.onecdn.static.microsoft)\nUDP 192.168.0.2:137\n\nThe tee utility and its expected behavior is fairly well-documented and known. I cannot find any justifiable explanation for this behavior.\n\nThe commit history shows that this binary was committed to the neovim/deps repo ~2 years ago via https://github.com/neovim/deps/commit/21c5e8bdda33521a6ed497b315e03265a2785cbc and that's where it's being sourced from when building neovim. Given this behavior, I'm inclined to suggest a root cause analysis should be performed and insist that this binary along with the others in the deps repo should be built from source.",

I didn't realize the connection to gvim from this point, spawned from issue https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14078.\n\nI think the above indicators are a red herring. It looks like if anything, these binaries _have_ good sources (gVim) that are documented and can be traced around to find the origin fairly easily. The introduction commit that added them to the codebase simply extracted a zip that contained vendor deps, which were bumped _as a result of security-adjacent concerns_.",
