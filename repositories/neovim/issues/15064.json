    "body": "I love `neovim` and have been using it since 2017 (just prior to version 0.2).  The features introduced in the latest 0.5 release (lua, LSP, treesitter etc.) make it even more awesome.\r\n\r\nI'd like to request the devs to consider a structure-based diff implementation (to complete the existing suite of line-based diffing algorithms already present i.e. Myers, patience, longest subsequence distance, histogram etc.). I recently came across [`difftastic`](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic), a structure-based diffing tool (even though this is currently a rough, unfinished product). To my untrained eye, structure-based diffing looks like a nice orthogonal idea that is worthwhile to implement. The creator of difftastic further points out some interesting structure-based diff tools in the project's [wiki page](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/wiki/Structural-Diffs).\r\n\r\nHere are some further related readings/tools (originally linked in the aforementioned wiki):\r\n\r\n1. [https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/08/28/graphtage/](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/08/28/graphtage/)\r\n2. [https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/sexpressiondiff/](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/sexpressiondiff/)\r\n3. [https://fazzone.github.io/autochrome.html](https://fazzone.github.io/autochrome.html)\r\n4. [https://github.com/yinwang0/psydiff](https://github.com/yinwang0/psydiff)\r\n5. [https://github.com/yinwang0/ydiff](https://github.com/yinwang0/ydiff)\r\n6. [https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/hdiff/tree/v0.0.5](https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/hdiff/tree/v0.0.5)\r\n7. [https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree)\r\n\r\nI gather that structure-based diffing might be a reasonably hot topic in academia, with a few good PhD theses and papers being published e.g. [https://victorcmiraldo.github.io/data/MiraldoPhD.pdf](https://victorcmiraldo.github.io/data/MiraldoPhD.pdf). \r\n\r\nI am just a user of neovim, often using it for writing notes, papers and application-level code, and do not have the background in data structures required to implement a sophisticated idea like this. I hope that the community here might be able to have a healthy debate on the pros and cons of considering a structure-based diff implementation within neovim.\r\n",
