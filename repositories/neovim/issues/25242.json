For those of us who'd want to optionally turn it off - I'm not going to propose anything ambitious like stale-while-revalidate or timeout or anything like that, just wrapping those lines in if-blocks and exposing a config option would solve it for me.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the config should look like, I've been using `vim.lsp.with` to configure my features, but is that the future? https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/22598#issuecomment-1463367606\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf I don't want to see the flicker, there should be an easy way to turn it off without editing Neovim source code",
