    "body": "Background: There are two common libc implementations for windows supplied by microsoft https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/#msvcrt-vs-ucrt\r\n\r\nImportantly, the newer runtime UCRT has native support for UTF-8, including setting it as the _active codepage_ even before `main()` gets called. On the other hand, msvcrt, which was the runtime when we initially implemented windows support, does not support UTF-8 at all, and requires the use of `wmain()` entry point (#7060) as well as using WCHAR variants of basic functions, such as opening a file (#18122) . Also, we use libuv for a lot of basic file operations even in fully sync contexts, as libuv hides the difference between incompatible windows runtimes for us (and does UTF-8 from/to WCHAR conversion internally)\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for neovim to **only support the UCRT runtime on windows** or at least formally drop support for msvcrt, realistically for the 0.10 development cycle. Then we can use standard libc functions for manipulating arguments and filenames, and remove/simplify a lot of the existing workarounds. Our own MSVC binaries now use UCRT with UTF-8 fully configured (#22384). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is a code path to compile neovim using MINGW/MSYS2 (earlier discussion: #22416 ). This would need to be adjusted to\r\n\r\n1. supply the same manifest information when compiled with UCRT (as in #22384)\r\n2. fail the build when attempting to build with MSVCRT.",

Any bug which only occurs on MSVCRT will have the recommended fix: switch to a UCRT build.\r\n\r\nFor 0.11 we will actively require UCRT on windows, and remove more support code which is no longer needed for a UCRT-only windows app.",
