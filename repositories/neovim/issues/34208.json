If for example, current-directory is `/` or `~` and a marker matches, we might end up with `/` or `~` as `root_dir`. To have a `root_dir` with so many files could be problematic depending on the language server and configuration?\n\nI'd be happy to make a pull request if agreement is reached.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`vim.fs.root()` returns `nil` when `source` is an unnamed or a special buffer.",

In the current behavior, we end up with the \"correct dir\"\n\n> anyway, we are only discussing `vim.fs.root()`. behavior of lsp attach must be decided in the lsp module, and is unrelated to the topic here.\n\nI agree that touching LSP is out of scope. It's just that `vim.fs.root()` is used by LSP and any modifications to `vim.fs.root()` will affect LSP.\n\nThis part is easy, I can start with it:\n- For the bufnr case:\n  - If `buftype` is not empty, return `nil`\n- For both string and bufnr cases:\n  - If `path` is empty, return `nil`\n\nI can create a separate issue/PR for deciding invalid or uri paths.",

The original \"Expected behavior\" here was not framed with the *semantic* change. \n\n@Mo-tmd  Is the \"Expected behavior\" that you do *not* want lsp clients to attach to matching filetypes just because they happen to not have a backing file? That definitely seems like a regression.\n\n\n\n> Is it reasonable that `vim.fs.root()` search falls back to Nvim's current-directory for unnamed and special buffers?\n\nIt's not a \"fallback\", it's a feature. Without that behavior, lsp just would never work for non-file buffers, which is clearly a regression for many use-cases.",

Most servers don't care about that, but it's causing issues (at least) with the Tailwind LSP: it tries to use `/` as a workspace directory (which is consistent with the info neovim is reporting).\n\nCan we reopen this discussion?",
