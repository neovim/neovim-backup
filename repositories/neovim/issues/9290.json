I was told just to make a custom completion script instead of patching the existing one, because this limitation is a \"feature\" and not a bug.\r\n\r\nI thought I would see what the folks at NeoVim think, as I see there are already some existing autocomplete improvement issues and I wanted to offer something much more limited in scope which could be realized without too much hassle.
