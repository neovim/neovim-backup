This (of course) makes it unusable.\nThis started happening starting with 0.11.0, was not a problem with 0.10.*\n\n---\n\nVersions:\n* Windows 11: 24H2 (OS Build 26100.4349)\n* FAR: 3.0.6446.0 x64\n* ConEmu: 230724 [64]\n* Neovim 0.11.2 (installed with `winget`)\n* I also tried Neovim 0.11.1 (bad), 0.11.2 (bad), 0.10.4 (good)\n* Also tried `nvim-win64.zip` downloaded from several GitHub releases\n* Also tried neovim I built myself at `HEAD` and at various tags (`v0.10.4`, `v0.11.0`, `v0.11.1`, `v0.11.2`)\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Install latest stable FAR Manager (https://www.farmanager.com/download.php or `winget install -i FarManager.FarManager`)\n* Install latest stable ConEmu (https://conemu.github.io/en/Downloads.html or `winget install Maximus5.ConEmu`)\n* Use any neovim you want (or `winget install Neovim.Neovim`)\n* Edit any file, or even just start Neovim without any file\n* The result is a screen with some background colors (if the file syntax requires them), but no foreground colors. So all the text is invisible, making Neovim unusable.\n\nI will try to attach or post an animated GIF.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nForeground colors, like in v0.10.**\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.2, also v0.12.0-dev-742+g025c070312, also commit 025c070312\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, several versions\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWin 11\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nConEmu + FAR Manager\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nconemu\n\n### Installation\n\nwinget, download from GitHub, self-built",
