I was thinking about the usefulness of setting an effect only valid for a buffer, say `id=1`, to a specific window, say `win=1002`. As I will usually move buffers around so that I can make two related ones adjacent for comparison. If moving the buffer of `id=1` out of that `win=1002` will disable an effect, this is counter-intuitive maybe only for me. For example, if I have enabled indent-line for buffer A, I will feel it cumbersome if later I view A in another window but find that there is no indent-line. I get used to thinking that windows are just viewports. Nevermind, maybe I was wrong.",
