Omitting the `win` could mean \"current window\". Or maybe the API should be different if there is another better way to communicate the intent.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is to allow that through `vim.wo` such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvim.wo[w][b] = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is to reference the progress on the topic, but the feature has already been thought of, as reported by the comments in the code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/2f22ed6a00db10c4852a8fa232b8782f8b6a6646/runtime/lua/vim/_options.lua#L207C10-L207C10",

I was thinking about the usefulness of setting an effect only valid for a buffer, say `id=1`, to a specific window, say `win=1002`. As I will usually move buffers around so that I can make two related ones adjacent for comparison. If moving the buffer of `id=1` out of that `win=1002` will disable an effect, this is counter-intuitive maybe only for me. For example, if I have enabled indent-line for buffer A, I will feel it cumbersome if later I view A in another window but find that there is no indent-line. I get used to thinking that windows are just viewports. Nevermind, maybe I was wrong.",
