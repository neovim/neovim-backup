    "body": "Continuing off of my comments in #36499, I believe it makes sense for `:restart` to default to `+qall` instead of `+qall!` in all situations, instead of just when using `:confirm`/`'confirm'`.\n\nReasons:\n- Removes the special case of `:confirm` adding confirmation to a command that would otherwise succeed, when normally it adds confirmation to a command that would otherwise fail.\n- Default behavior of `:restart` probably should not be to silently discard modifications.\n- Easy to restore original behavior with `:restart +qall!` (note that as of #36499, this now needs to be done anyway if 'confirm' is true).\n\nI would love to implement this change myself and submit a PR. Just opening an issue first to confirm that this change is wanted. @justinmk mentioning you because you expressed some agreement with this.",
