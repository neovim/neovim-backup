This introduces the need for some global state, something like a `buffers_to_be_detached` table that has to be persisted;\r\n  \r\n  * the value of that state has to be checked every time one of the attached callbacks is executed to know if it should detach or continue as usual, introducing some (probably minimal, but still annoying) unnecessary overhead;\r\n  \r\nSomething like a `vim.api.nvim_buf_detach` function taking a list of buffer numbers would solve both these problems. The help docs already mention such a function under `:h nvim_buf_detach`, but it's not actually present in the `vim.api` table.",
