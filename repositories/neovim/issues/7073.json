It also doesn't help on Windows, where the entire path has a very small limit.\r\n\r\nA different approach would be to compress the path and store the result as a base64-encoded filename.",

AFAIK we do not have any compression libraries linked yet. But we do have hash implementation.\r\n2. Hash size is constant.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1. One will need to parse undo file to get the file name because hashing is a one-way path. And we will need to actually add the filename there, and provide some way to get it out: for scripting purposes, somebody may want to do smart clean-up.\r\n2. To be safe it is needed to handle collisions, file path in the undo file will also come handy. Theoretically this will also destroy 2. from pros, but in practice I doubt you will ever get even 100 sha256 collisions on file names on a single machine.",

I think the issue is the fact that I have home folder encryption (I have to, because ISO 27001) which for some reason vastly reduces max filename length (from 255 to 143). But I can see large projects having issues anyway. The only \"solution\" seems to be to disable the `undofile` or just deal with it :/ ",

OneDrive just refuses to sync whole folders until you remove the one file that takes the path over the limit.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we're not going to fix Windows here. But I'd propose that rather than being a configurable option, why not have the path-hashing behaviour as the fallback behaviour in the event that a tempfile name would trigger E828? This retains the previous naming behaviour (which is presumably regarded as a feature) for as many cases as possible, but preserves being able to have undo for paths that exceed the limit.",
