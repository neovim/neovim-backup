It also doesn't help on Windows, where the entire path has a very small limit.\r\n\r\nA different approach would be to compress the path and store the result as a base64-encoded filename.",

AFAIK we do not have any compression libraries linked yet. But we do have hash implementation.\r\n2. Hash size is constant.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1. One will need to parse undo file to get the file name because hashing is a one-way path. And we will need to actually add the filename there, and provide some way to get it out: for scripting purposes, somebody may want to do smart clean-up.\r\n2. To be safe it is needed to handle collisions, file path in the undo file will also come handy. Theoretically this will also destroy 2. from pros, but in practice I doubt you will ever get even 100 sha256 collisions on file names on a single machine.",

I am running on Linux and ext4. I think the issue is the fact that I have home folder encryption (I have to, because ISO 27001) which for some reason vastly reduces max filename length (from 255 to 143). But I can see large projects having issues anyway. The only \"solution\" seems to be to disable the `undofile` or just deal with it :/ ",
