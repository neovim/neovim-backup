But then I have to press another key to close the window. This isn't a huge deal of course, but it does irk me since it's a completely unnecessary keypress. I will never need to examine the terminal output after `lazygit` exits, so it would feel a lot nicer if I could simply press `q` and go right back to the file I was editing.\r\n\r\nThe same is true when I just want to open a quick terminal to examine something in the command line. When I press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to exit the terminal, it feels unnecessary to have to press another key to close the window.\r\n\r\nI would love an option when opening a new terminal to not prompt for a keypress after the command exits.\r\n\r\nMaybe:\r\n\r\n```vim\r\n:terminal <noprompt> lazygit\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI tried hacking together a workaround using `TermClose`, but it seems that event fires before the prompt is displayed, so I'm not sure if it can work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nautocmd TermClose term://*lazygit <CR>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597206/124392950-676b0880-dcf8-11eb-812f-32c6b59d1551.png)\r\n",

I tried to set `autocmd TermClose * call nvim_input('<CR>')` and it sent an enter to an unrelated buffer instead of the terminal one, `autocmd TermClose * quit` closed _just_ the other non-terminal buffer, etc.\r\n\r\nDid you try what @justinmk suggested and use `bdelete!`? It's no surprise that `call nvim_input('<CR>')` didn't work, as the autocommand does not automatically focus the terminal buffer before executing the command. `bdelete` should work just fine though, as all _buffer_ commands (such as `:bdelete`) do execute in the context of the autocommand buffer.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should be adding any options to `:terminal`. We should instead just create better defaults. I think a good start would be to automatically close the terminal buffer if the user did not provide a `{cmd}` to `:terminal` **AND** the terminal exits with status code 0 (no errors).\r\n\r\nThis should be pretty easy to implement once #15406 is merged.",

Users with a custom statusline can get the exit code via `nvim_chan_get()`.\r\n\r\n## Proposal 2\r\n\r\nAllow job handlers to be defined on existing jobs: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/5023 . Then the exit-code can be captured by a Lua callback which sets the statusline or whatever.",
