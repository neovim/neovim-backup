Else I’ll create a dedicated issue for it.\n\nCurrently, vim.pack only supports a single dedicated package (as defined by `vim.pack-directory`). And unfortunately it makes all plugins within this package `opt`ional (into the `opt` folder). However, plenty of plugins I would like be installed as a `start` plugin (into the `start` folder). So they get loaded automatically during start, based on the regular startup procedure. No fuzz to load them via my configuration explicitly every time. Plain NeoVim.\n\nI must admit I’m a little confused about the approach that vim.pack takes, by installing all plugins as optionally, but loads them “immediately” afterwards (using `vim.cmd.packadd`). You must actually opt out via a custom `load` function. A little awkward to me.\n\nMy current approach is to avoid the whole plugin manager noise during startup. In exact I don’t call any plugin manager functionality in any automatically loaded file. Instead I put these calls into dedicated files in the runtime path where NeoVim ignores them per default. If I wanna have any plugins become installed or updated, I can source them on demand via `vim.cmd.runtime({ 'START plugin_specification.lua', bang = true })` (the file name is my own convention).\nI have my own lazy loading functionality in place to load optional plugins where meaningful. However, I rely also on simple, plain, strait forward `start` plugins.\n\nAre there any plans to support start plugins as well as optional plugins for the same core package managed via vim.pack?\n\nThank you!",

            "body": "> As far as I'm aware, most third-party package managers work the same way as `vim.pack`, where they do not load plugins that are not explicitly declared in code. For instance, `lazy.nvim` and `mini.deps` both behave this way.\n\nYou're right that many plugin managers work the way you describe, but there are plugin managers that work in other ways. They will install to start/ (if the user wants), and they don't have to run every time that Neovim starts. Neovim, like Vim, already has mechanisms to load plugins. You don't necessarily need a plugin manager to control that.\n\n@weilbith, take a look at [paq.nvim](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim). In particular, look for the Bootstraping section in the docs. ([This is what I used](https://github.com/telemachus/dotfiles/blob/2f66f2eef9df92aeeaad2df1e04ad7e4c9fe3108/config/nvim/lua/headless.lua) for a long time. You can have a cron job start Neovim in headless mode and run a script like that however often you want. When Neovim starts, no plugin manager runs, just the editor.)",
