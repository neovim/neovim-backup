    "body": "### Problem\n\nI noticed a flicker where the startup screen was shown for a split second after updating neovim. After running a git bisect, I have narrowed it down to 2b4c1127ad1c8cff38f562d71f411c35ec6ba8d6. There seems to have been a regression in clearing the startup screen for dashboards to take over. Previously nothing of the startup screen was shown, but now that screen is shown for a split second before a dashboard takes over\n\nThis seems to only be a problem when extui is enabled as well\n\n# Before bad commit\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ef9794e-39ed-4817-b40b-3cac7e4b0d83\n\n# After bad commit\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/934a7fe8-f0d2-498c-a16f-6813e35ba61f\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\ninit.lua\n```lua\nfor name, url in pairs({\n\tstartify = \"https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify\",\n}) do\n\tlocal install_path = vim.fn.fnamemodify(\".repro/\" .. name, \":p\")\n\tif vim.fn.isdirectory(install_path) == 0 then\n\t\tvim.fn.system({ \"git\", \"clone\", \"--depth=1\", url, install_path })\n\tend\n\tvim.opt.runtimepath:append(install_path)\nend\nrequire(\"vim._extui\").enable({})\n```\n\nIt can also be sort of reproduced with just enabling extui and then setting a colorscheme to something different than the default one like this. Note that it doesn't happen every single time with this, but often enough to easily reproduce it:\n\n```lua\nrequire(\"vim._extui\").enable({})\nvim.cmd.colorscheme(\"catppuccin\")\n```\n\nThe colorscheme used is this one: https://github.com/seblyng/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/colors/catppuccin.lua\n\nYou can notice since the colors are different from the default ones, the default ones are first applied and show for a split second, before the colorscheme I set overrides them. This was not the case previously.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect it to not show the startup screen and \"flicker\"\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-691+gf1f106be3d\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGhostty 1.1.3\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from source",
