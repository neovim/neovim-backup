I'm not sure what exactly the rhyme or reason is, but it's often a single character repeated, or something I had yanked, or maybe something under my cursor.\n\nAbout a week ago I realized it probably has something to do with ESC being remapped to jk. Going back to the old-fashioned ESC key appears to have eliminated the issue.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI cannot reproduce this bug consistently, or very often. The single commonality between each instance of it occurring is using 'jk' to ESC, and has done so since neovim was only a few months old. I've had this happen using foot, alacritty, urxvt, and gnome-terminal, with and without tmux, and without any nvim plugins at all.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen jk is mapped to ESC, it should escape cleanly.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArchLinux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nFoot 1.24 (and others)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nFoot\n\n### Installation\n\nArch repos",
