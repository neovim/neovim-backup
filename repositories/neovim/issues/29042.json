This has become especially cumbersome since as of v0.10.0, neovim expects multiple builtin tree-sitter parsers to be available at `<prefix>/lib/nvim/parser` or otherwise will throw runtime errors on common tasks like opening `:help`.\r\n\r\nEven worse is the fact that the toplevel cmake silently does or does not use the parsers in `.deps` depending on whether they were built manually before, so forgetting to build them can easily go through unnoticed, which is what initially happened in MacPorts. Using the wrapper Makefile is not a good option there.\r\n\r\nCMake has extensive builtin functionality for embedding other cmake roots, from e.g. a simple `add_subdirectory` to ExternalProject/FetchContent. Having `cmake.deps/` as a standalone-buildable project makes sense because you can point multiple neovim builds to it. But I was not able to find reasons in the codebase or past issues why there had to be a wrapper-Makefile around the toplevel cmake for tasks that cmake itself should be able to handle just fine.\r\nSo my question is: Was this a deliberate design decision and what was the reasoning behind it?\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI could imagine a build system like this:\r\n* `cmake.deps/` stays mostly as-is: A standalone project for bundled dependencies\r\n* The toplevel CMakeLists.txt can (using options) be manually pointed to a `.deps` folder, told to not use bundled dependencies at all, or it will embed `cmake.deps/` itself using something like ExternalProject and build and manage a specified subset of dependencies in its own build dir. It should fail the build if building any of the dependencies fails.\r\n* Makefile can be removed, or at least stripped down a lot to only go through the toplevel cmake.",

An attempt of this was made in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/22054 and the problem is that `FetchContent` only works with projects who use cmake and we have many dependencies who don't use cmake. We can't use ExternalProject either as that is run during build time instead of configure time which will make the main build error as dependencies (that now don't exist) need to be resolved in configure time. It's a nasty situation cmake has explicitly expressed they will not try to fix as \"cmake is not a package manager\". A workaround for this is to fork all our dependencies that don't use cmake and add a top level `Cmakelists.txt` file or something, but it didn't seem popular when I brought this up. The best hope I can give is that we may change the build system in the future: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28344.\r\n\r\nWith that background out of the way: I don't quite understand why this is a problem. Distros are usually expected to package everything themselves and should able to just run the main build since all dependencies are already available. I don't quite get what blocks you from just using the main file (assuming you've already packaged all dependencies).",

If you mean that we should _treat_ them as they are part of neovim (like with runtime files) then that is a different question. \r\n\r\nThe latter. It seems more logical to me that in the specific case of the parsers, which need to be an exact version and installed in an nvim-specific location, they are part of the core nvim build itself.\r\nIt would also be more convenient if I build manually since right now I am forced to build `cmake.deps/` for the parsers, even if I try to supply all dependencies from my distribution because the parsers can't be reliably used from generic packages.\r\n\r\n> It's probably not a popular suggestion as other distros will throw a hissy fit, although I don't remember exactly why. They don't like this though.\r\n\r\nThey usually want a library to be installed in a single location by a single package, so it can be patched and updated for bug and security fixes without having to dig through all downstream packages that use it and where it might be bundled somehow with an outdated version.\r\nThis is absolutely reasonable for most dependencies, but not so much for the neovim parsers as those have to be an exact version. Of course one could split it into e.g. two packages `neovim` and `neovim-parsers`, but that does not bring much benefit as `neovim-parsers` has no purpose other than being a dependency of `neovim` and can't be updated independently anyway.\r\n\r\n> I still don't understand why packaging the parsers are not an option. Is it too much work to package the parsers or what's the problem?\r\n\r\nIt is an option, but it is not perfect. Basically there are two possibilities:\r\n* Split neovim in two packages as described above. Works, but produces unnecessary overhead.\r\n* Build the parsers as a \"pre-configure\" step, as done here: https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/pull/24120/files#diff-b34df68f0c13c7ef026ff83093a1a67b40081bbae10e7d3ebb413781be46ae53R50-R53 Works too, but requires jumping through hoops to pass all the right arguments as the MacPorts-native cmake integration can't be used for this step.",

The \"build\" of the parser packages re-generates the `src/` directory using tree-sitter-cli and then builds a package from that. This package contains the code needed to build the .so as well as a helper Makefile to hide the details of the build itself. The intent is that from the perspective of packages needing parsers, they have a standard mechanism to build any of the packaged parsers.\r\n\r\nThen neovim (and eventually other packages) have build dependencies on, e.g., tree-sitter-c-src, and use the respective helper Makefile to build the version of the parser they need. They then install the resulting shared object where needed (in `&rtp/parser/<foo>.so` for neovim).\r\n\r\nIt's all structured so that, if needed, multiple versions of a parser can be available and each dependent package can build the one it needs, although neovim is currently the only consumer so I haven't actually started providing multiple versions.\r\n\r\nYes, this was a lot of up front work, but it ensures Debian can regenerate all parsers, if needed, and provides a standard interface (which I can simplify going forward) that any package in Debian can use. Adding new parsers is pretty simple. Updating the tree-sitter tooling is much more involved.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAll that being said, I also understand that given the current state of the tree-sitter ecosystem, it's much more attractive to just make Neovim build everything itself. At a minimum, that would require vendoring the parsers, since many distributions don't allow network access during the build.",
