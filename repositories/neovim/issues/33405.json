    "body": "### Problem\n\n#32013 (first released in 0.11.0) made standard error output from `:!` commands be highlighted in `ErrorMsg`.\n\nWhile I welcome this change in general, I also find it quite annoying and distracting. That's because CLI commands use stderr for all kinds of things, not just errors. For example, several tools use it to display progress, or log messages, especially if they are also intended to be used in a pipe with their stdout going to another program.\n\nHere's `git push` displaying a success message in bright red:\n\n![The Ex command \":!git push\" printing the result \"Everything up-to-date\", but that output has a bright red background, making it look like an error.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d2e6245-9040-402d-b8eb-0cf4c4dd481b)\n\nTo me, this is confusing and irritating. It might also lead to some kind of alert fatigue, where users stop paying attention to actual errors, because success messages are now also red.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\nnvim --clean\n:!echo out; echo err >&2\n```\n\nWith the default color scheme, the `ErrorMsg` highlight is pretty subtle, but feel free to try it with something like `:colorscheme desert`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI see two options to solve this:\n\n1. Introduce a new highlight group for stderr output, so that people can make the highlighting more subtle without changing how `ErrorMsg` is displayed throughout the rest of Neovim. (This is my preferred solution, and it would probably make sense to introduce a new highlight group for stdout as well while you're at it.)\n2. Make stderr highlighting an option, so that people can disable it.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, Vim 9.0.2142 doesn't have that feature\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian bookworm\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.26.5\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nbinary release tarball",
