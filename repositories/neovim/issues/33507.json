I was told this has to be a Neovim bug so I tried with other terminal emulators as well. The problem I have described in the linked issue can be reliably reproduced in the same manner with [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) and [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty). It does not occur with [wezterm](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm) or [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).\n\nThe occurrence of this problem coincides with Neovim emitting a `CSI t 8` control sequence which kitty and Ghostty do not support. They emit error messages to that effect. Neovim emits the same sequence when starting, exiting, or being resized but in those cases the program to receive the false input is Neovim itself which does not show any negative symptoms.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run kitty (or foot or Ghostty) with defaults: `kitty -c NONE`\n2. Run Neovim in that kitty window without any plugins and with defaults: `nvim -u NONE`\n3. Press [Ctrl]+[Z] to suspend.\n4. Issue `fg` to foreground the suspended Neovim.\n5. Press [Ctrl]+[Z] again.\n6. See the string `8;49;213;1372;2556t` prepended to command line and hear a terminal beep.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA suspend followed by a command prompt should not prepend characters to the command line.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0 (official Arch Linux package)\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo. Vim 9.1.1236 (official Arch Linux package). This error does appear in kitty's stderr: \"The application is trying to use xterm's modifyOtherKeys. This is superseded by the kitty keyboard protocol https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol. The application should be updated to use that.\"\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nKitty. Tried with foot, Ghostty, Alacritty, wezterm as well, with different results.\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nOfficial Arch Linux package.",
