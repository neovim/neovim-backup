The buffer behaves as if it were empty (e.g. does not permit cursor movement, `:w !wc -c` prints 0) so I don't think it is a result of display corruption.\r\n\r\nI was able to bisect the issue.  The commit which introduced the issue appears to be 8bee2ff19d8d3a94d6d8e1912c46cb33f8481a5b.",

Similar behaviour is observed in Vim with `:checktime` and `set autoread`.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should skip fifos (and maybe some other special file buffers) in `buf_check_timestamp` maybe?\r\nOr maybe don't `check_timestamps` at all for the initial `FocusGained` event?",
