    "body": "Per https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11745, we have `nvim_buf_set_extmark` that anchors some decoration to a buffer position.\r\n\r\nI propose we extend this functionality to allow interactive extmarks, i.e. UI widgets (or controls).\r\n\r\nIn order to support flexible UI elements, the following features should be provided:\r\n\r\n- Decoupled rendering: the interactive extmark should be rendered by the UI, which could be something else than a few cells in the grid\r\n- Geometry bounds: an UI element may span across multiple lines, but the principle is that it anchors to a rectangular region in a grid. neovim should also send move/resize events to the frontend so that the controls move/resize/clip in sync with buffer scrolling.\r\n- In order to support rich front-end display, an interactive extmark can carry some metadata that acts as the data context of the front-end view.\r\n- Lifetime management: each element should have a unique id (which is already the case for extmarks?), and neovim should notify the frontends when the controls scroll into/out of the view, so that non-displayed ones can be recycled.\r\n- Widget event handling: frontend can send back messages about interaction events.\r\n- View model logic: one can program in vimL or lua as a plugin, to model the behavior for a view model.\r\n\r\nThis can enhance NeoVim in a few interesting ways, for example, better debugging interface (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11732)\r\n\r\nAlso, to honor cursor-centric interaction paradigm, I also recommend having the data context mapped as a hidden buffer object, so that the vim motions done in the data context can be reflected on the view in the frontend. For example, if there's a two-column table:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------------+------------------+\r\n| [Title 1]      | [Input box]      |\r\n|----------------+------------------|\r\n| [Title 2]      | [||||||--------] |\r\n|----------------+------------------|\r\n| [Title 3]      | +--------------+ |\r\n|                | | [x] Option 1 | |\r\n|                | | [ ] Option 2 | |\r\n|                | | [ ] Option 3 | |\r\n|                | | [ ] Option 4 | |\r\n|                | | [ ] Option 5 | |\r\n|                | +--------------+ |\r\n|----------------+------------------|\r\n| [Title 4]      | [------|---] 60% |\r\n|                | +--------------+ |\r\n|                | |   Confirm    | |\r\n|                | +--------------+ |\r\n+----------------+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe data context may be designed as a csv table to correspond to the view:\r\n\r\n```csv\r\nTitle 1,Input box,\r\nTitle 2,30/100,\r\nTitle 3,x,Option 1\r\n,,Option 2\r\n,,Option 3\r\n,,Option 4\r\n,,Option 5\r\nTitle 4,60/100\r\n,Confirm\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause there's one-to-one mapping between the two, the motions done in the data context can also be translated intuitively on where we want to go in the view. \r\nFor example:\r\n- when the focus is on \"Title 1\", key in `2jw` to move focus to \"[x] Option 1\", and `^]` to activate the \"select\" event without even needing the frontend to send back a message.\r\n- `/60<CR>10^a` raises the Title 4 slider to 70%\r\n- `/confirm<CR>^]` finds the button and press it.",
