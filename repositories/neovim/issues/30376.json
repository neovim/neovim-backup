Bram also was [favorable to that idea](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/66f65a46c5d169f20f780721d4f74d4729855b96/runtime/doc/todo.txt#L1484).\n\nWould be nice to see a PR for that... Let's use this issue to track that idea.\n\n## Implementation notes\n\n- One way to implement this is to re-use the internals of `:help execute()` : https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/e049c6e4c08a141c94218672e770f86f91c27a11/src/nvim/eval/funcs.c#L1592-L1594\n    - Or rather than directly using those internals, the C code can invoke vimscript:\n      ```\n      execute(printf(\"put=execute('%s')\", substitute(escape(<q-args>, '\"')\n      ```\n- Note also that \"mods\" should be supported, i.e. `:split read :foo` should collect the output of `:foo` *before*` splitting the window (otherwise this isn't useful).\n- A good place for tests would be `test/functional/ex_cmds/` . There is currently no `read_spec.lua` in there, but perhaps could use `test/functional/ex_cmds/write_spec.lua` as a starting point.\n",
