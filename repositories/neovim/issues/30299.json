Please consider setting the default to full black, so that on OLED the background can be *off*, which provides less overall light-in-the-eyes for reading comfort, as well as better battery life for laptops and other mobile devices.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that you're balancing many conflicting needs and desires here, and I will understand if this ends up being a matter for configuration. (In which case, I might contribute a PR for a color scheme that inherits the default and sets the background.)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n(use vim on an OLED display)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBackground pixels turned off.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.1 Build type: Release LuaJIT 2.1.1725453128\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno, all versions of vim\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nAndroid 14\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\ntermux\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\ntermux",
