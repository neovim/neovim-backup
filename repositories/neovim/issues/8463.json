When neovim sees the zombied process, it acts as if the process were still alive and suppresses that option.\r\n\r\n@justinmk under unix (but not under Windows), a process becomes a zombie if it has exited but its process record remains in the kernel to provide information to the parent. The entry for the process is kept alive even after the process has exited until the parent retrieves information about the exit code/status of the child process. \r\n\r\nSo programmatically, if a parent were to spawn a process but not call `waitpid()` (and the parent remains alive), then the child exits, it will be turned into a zombie process until either the parent exits or the parent calls `waitpid` to retrieve that info. If the parent exits/dies, `init` inherits ownership of the process and the child's pid is reaped.\r\n\r\nUnder Windows there is no concept of zombie processes at all. When `CreateProcess` is called, the handle returned can be used to query information about the child process (but many wrappers around it such as `ShellExecute()` by default opt to not providing a child handle and closing it instead), and that handle persists (keeping the process entry in the kernel table alive) until the handle is closed or the parent exits, but this does not affect the enumeration of currently running processes nor does it cause the process to be considered \"alive\" when querying it by pid.",
