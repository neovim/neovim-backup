Inserts it in the respective places\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/665a0e85c4788cb2847e270c333c0aee306f07ad/src/nvim/ops.c#L2473-L2475\n\nI've encountered the following problems:\n\n## backspaces\n\nIt doesn't handle `<bs>`, `<c-w>`, `<c-u>` or any other form of insert mode text deletion because it doesn't need to. When inserting text in real time this would be necessary. I'm my on-progress naive implementation I'm handling it  in `del_bytes`\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/665a0e85c4788cb2847e270c333c0aee306f07ad/src/nvim/change.c#L871\n\n## newlines\n\nIt doesn't do anything if the cursor moved to a different line\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/665a0e85c4788cb2847e270c333c0aee306f07ad/src/nvim/ops.c#L2372-L2374\n\nIt would have to undo only the visual block inserted text to keep the current behavior.\n\nI was trying the idea of simply disabling visual block insert when a newline is entered and continue as regular insert mode, hence my question.\n",

See also [paste_store](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/0bef3b911cc262a007fb4412d864c1832d1268ad/src/nvim/getchar.c#L3223) for a related concept.\n\nBut that could get tricky, may be equivalent to a \"multicursor\" implementation.\n\n\n> I think this could be done more like how `:s` works\n\nSGTM. With test coverage, we can always change the implementation later.\n",
