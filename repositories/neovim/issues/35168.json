    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe `:help` command is fairly complex¹ and thus difficult to emulate or [customize the behaviour of](https://git.buny.computer/lambda/dotfiles/src/branch/nvim/lua/config/autocmds.lua#L18-L31).\n\nIn particular opening multiple help windows in some consistent manner is very difficult.\n\n¹ See `:help :help` for some of the window handling, i18n, tags etc, as well as `:help help-buffer-options`, `:help help-curwin`...\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim allows creating multiple help buffers. There is still a \"primary\" help window created/reopened by `:help` and targeted by `:helpclose`, `:helpgrep` et. al, help buffers created any other way are considered \"secondary\".\n\nA new `:[bufnr]help ...` command is added that takes buffer `bufnr` and turns it into a \"secondary\" help buffer. `keywordprg` is accordingly set to `:<bufnr>help` instead of `:help`. All non-window/buffer related functionality remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, a `helpopen` function similar to `jobstart(..., { term: v:true })` (previously `termopen(...)`) that takes the \"current (unmodified) buffer\" and turns it into a \"secondary\" help buffer.\n\nThe ability to open multiple help buffers is intended to help with the following scenarios:\n\n1. Plugins that wish to open a help buffer in more specific ways such as floating windows can do so more easily as well as not interfere with the user's existing windows in the process\n2. When referencing larger pages such as `api.txt`, `lua.txt`, having multiple windows/tabs open is (subjectively) preferable to having to jump back and forth between help topics with Ctrl-O/Ctrl-I/etc.\n3. [subjective argument] It makes help buffers slightly less 'special-cased', brings behaviour a bit more in line with something like `:terminal` (can conditionally replace/unload a buffer instead of hiding it, option handling, ...)",
