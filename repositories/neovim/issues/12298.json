I can imagine two ways of doing this, either add a `$` at the end of the current `r` option (e.g. `set shada='10,rCOMMIT_EDITMSG$`) to \"anchor\" the string to the end of the path, or create a new option, for example `R` (e.g. `set shada='10,RCOMMIT_EDITMSG`).\r\n\r\nIf this feature makes sense to you, I think implementing it would only require adding a check to this function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/55b62a937c27715f7e6c299ae312c38edf08fa74/src/nvim/shada.c#L4057-L4078\r\n\r\nI'm absolutely willing to work on this myself.",
