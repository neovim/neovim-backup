It looks great\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4a935f-0ab5-4a2b-8d5f-d39cdd14fbf8)\n\n\nBut now if a file has only a few lines it looks bad again (look at two windows in the middle)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/520a5ca6-dc21-4664-850c-909b99009639)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI want an option such as statussymbolforcefullheight to force status symbol to be 100%\n\nI'm open to other alternatives but there is no AFAIK \"│\" that are right or left aligned. Because if it existed maybe I could do so statusymbol is left aligned and window separator is left or right aligned (depending on position on the window I guess) so status symbol and window separator would merge into one thicker line.\nThat would be perfect but I cannot find unicode symbol left/right aligned and 100% height and vim doesn't provide a way AFAIK to change window separator based on buffer's position.\n\nThere's also other big problems with my method:\n- The intersections of windows: I cannot use the proper intersection unicode character because otherwise it would one column too far left. The reason for that is window separator is invisible, status column acts as a sort of window separator but it's one column to the right.\n- Dragging window is super hard. I have to always click the invisible symbol one column left of status column because it's the real window separator (but invisible).\n\nI wished there was just a way to merge the concept of window separator and status symbol (maybe just apply the color highlight on the window separator itself)",

Two options\n\n### Option 1\nTo achieve that I can carry on using status symbol but multiple points are blocking : we need a statuslineheight, we might want (for better look) to handler corners that are one column off, dragging windows should be made easier (currently it's one column off because window separator is invisible, either we have option to move left status column or we have option to move the area that's draggable).\nSeems a bit much (and require manual configuration of user for statuslineheight, for characters of status symbol etc.)\n\n### Option 2\n\nThe alternative I can think of that would levarage the laststatus=3 code would just add highlights to window separators. It would solve all of the issue above and avoid any kind of manual setup (as laststatus=3 has already all the proper unicode).\n\nAlso we'd need https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33041to also have no statusline (not strictly required but cleaner UI especially now the issues with noice I think have been fixed on 0.11 statusline is not needed anymore for most cases).\n\nBTW I thought my issue would be disregarded as very minor and niche. I'm glad some core members agree the look looks good and is open to improving the implementation of it :)  ",
