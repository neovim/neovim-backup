I wanted to provide the timeframe from which I saw passing tests and until I started see failing ones.\n\nThe CI jobs mentions \"stable\" or \"nightly\" and logs the versions used. Inside the last successfull CI execution, there's a step mentioning the Neovim version. In this case, the passing tests use `NVIM v0.12.0-dev-1341+g28ccebd138`, meaning the issue was introduced in a later Neovim nightly version. I edited my original post to make this more clear. ",
