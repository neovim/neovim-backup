Evidently, vim expects a terminal cell to be occupied by shy while some terminals render it as a zero-width space.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. create shy.txt\r\n```console\r\n$ xxd -r > shy.txt <<EOF\r\n00000000: 3230 203e 3ec2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2  20 >>...........\r\n00000010: adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2  ................\r\n00000020: adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 adc2 ad0a c2ad  ................\r\n00000030: c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad  ................\r\n00000040: c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad  ................\r\n00000050: c2ad c2ad c2ad 3c3c 2032 300a 3230 203e  ......<< 20.20 >\r\n00000060: c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad  ................\r\n00000070: c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad  ................\r\n00000080: c2ad c2ad c2ad c2ad 3c20 3230 0a         ........< 20.\r\nEOF\r\n```\r\n2. vim shy.txt, do some editting (press `ddp` to swap first and second line)\r\n3. note rendering artifacts\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nActual:­­\r\n<img width=\"277\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-06 at 6 28 41 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/assets/112430378/9e0882c2-032c-413b-9b21-d29dc9e8b106\">\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n<img width=\"276\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/assets/112430378/25e56a87-de53-4445-a74e-75d9f396c7a7\">\r\n\r\nThe \"Expected\" was obtained by simply backgrounding (`ctrl+z`) then foregrounding (`fg`) the same vim session as \"Actual\", above.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to do what I do with other whitespace, as in:\r\n\r\n 1. `:set listchars=tab:→·,extends:»,precedes:«,nbsp:␠,trail:␠,shy:⧷`\r\n 2. `:set list`\r\n 3.
