It’s just a regular buffer that Emacs uses for commands, prompts, and interactive input which expands what we would call the 'cmdheight', pushing the statusline up and displaying content. \n>\n> It creates a unified interface. Instead of having one plugin open a floating popup for fuzzy file search, another showing a completion menu at the bottom, and yet another drawing a quickfix list in a split, many things can use the minibuffer. That means:\n>\n> - Running commands with completion.\n> - Fuzzy finding files or buffers.\n> - Even interactive plugin UIs (think Telescope, fzf, etc).\n\n\nWith Nvim 0.12 + `vim._extui` enabled, cmdline and pager are real buffers. But we might still be missing a \"unified interface\".\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nSomething analogous to `:help preview-window`: \n\n- Establish a global, unified concept for collecting input (cmdline, fuzzy-finding and executing an action based on that input.\n- Third-party plugins can \"provide\" interfaces (fuzzy-finding, completion) in this unified concept.\n\nTo keep the door open for this, do we need to change anything in the `vim._extui` interface before release? @luukvbaal \n\nNote: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/660 is related, but the goal of this issue is much more constrained: just establish the standard mechanism for presenting these things.",
