    "body": "### Problem\n\nGood day to all, I'm Pedro and this is my first contribution. I would like to bring to attention some behavior that is conflicting with the documentation regarding the steps on building the current release from source.\n\nWhen compiling & installing from source on Fedora Workstation 41 and trying to specify the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE argument, `BUILD.md` instructs to build using two separate steps:  \n`make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo`\nfollowed by\n`make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DIR`. where $DIR is the desired install path (optional).\n\nHowever, following these steps as they are laid out and running :checkhealth will reveal that Neovim was built without optimizations (build type is set to Debug, the default).\n\nHere is the head of the output when running`$ make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DIR install`:  ($DIR is in my case, ~/.local/nvim) \n`Re-running CMake: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX '/home/pg-engine/.local/nvim' does not match cached value '/usr/local'.\nmkdir -p \".deps\"  \n/usr/bin/cmake3 -S /home/pg-engine/neovim//cmake.deps -B \".deps\" -G \"Ninja\"    \n-- Found GNU Make at /usr/bin/gmake    \n-- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo  \n-- Configuring done (0.2s)  \n-- Generating done (0.0s)  \n-- Build files have been written to: /home/pg-engine/neovim/.deps  \nmkdir -p build  \ntouch \"build/.ran-deps-cmake\"  \n/usr/bin/cmake3 --build \".deps\"  \nninja: no work to do.  \n/usr/bin/cmake3 -B build -G \"Ninja\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE= -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/pg-engine/.local/nvim /home/pg-engine/neovim/  \n-- Found GNU Make at /usr/bin/gmake  \n-- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/pg-engine/.local/nvim  \n-- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE not specified, default is 'Debug'`  \n\n\nAs you can see, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE was set to RelWithDebInfo, and yet a few lines later, it says it's unset and defaults to Debug.\n\nThis can easily be worked around by combining `make` and `make install` in the same step, as such:\n`$ make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/nvim install`\n\nIt's not much, but it does seem like unexpected behavior when BUILD.md provides these as the 'official' building steps.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1) Clone from the stable branch.  \n2) Build the specified build type using `make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` followed by `make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DIR` where dir would be install dir (probably optional but that's what's on BUILD.md and that's what I did). One command followed by the other.\n3) Run :checkhealth on the installed program and verify that CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE was indeed reset to Debug.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n1) Clone from the stable branch.  \n2) Build the specified build type using `make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` followed by `make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DIR` where dir would be install dir (probably optional but that's what's on BUILD.md and that's what I did). One command followed by the other.\n3) Run :checkhealth on the installed program and verify that CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE has retained the RelWithDebInfo value and that \"release with debug information\" is the build as specified in the previous step.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.4 \n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno (build instructions direct towards ./configure --args)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUp to date Fedora Workstation 41, KDE Plasma (Wayland)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.15.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nbuilt from repo\n\n**Edit:** minor formatting and textual clarity",
