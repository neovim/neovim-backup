But there have been much fewer reports about it, since very few plugins actually use that feature.\r\n\r\nBut I have been busy with finally getting things ready for a new Neovide release. And one of the things is a very hacky way to get it working with the current released neovim version.\r\n* https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2165\r\n\r\nMy solution is based on detecting the highlight groups, which are in no way guaranteed, but that's the only information we have currently. So, with that a line with only float borders is considered a top or bottom border, and so is any line with at least one winbar highlight.\r\n\r\nThere's also the problem that the `ext_hlstate` only reports the names of the final highlight group in case of links, so another hack had to be done to work around that:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2165/files#diff-96e67d744565c0dc461711b437b734a4d58cdc3ddac82c61fe7d722db3573f9bR106-R121\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that I think are documented wrong about the `hl_state`, and indicated so by comments in that PR.",

            "body": "I have been thinking about this and going to start working on a solution soon. \r\n\r\nI think we need to remain flexible and allow these \"widgets\" anywhere in the window, not just around the borders. Static information related to the window is also a little bit inflexible, for example, consider the floating window titles, they also need the exact position horizontally (to prevent one of errors, by having the clients calculate it themselves. There are also elements like splits, that does not belong to a window, but still, something that an UI might want to know about. For example, in Neovide we would like to display a different cursor when the mouse is over a split, once `mouseshape` support is implemented https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21458. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I'm planning to base my implementation based on the `ext_hlstate`, but a different extension that does not suffer from the performance issues associated with that and not affected by the theming. I'm probably going to call it `ext_elementtype`, and the idea would be that `hl_attr_define` gets a new field `element_type`, which describes the type of elements, an initial list could be something like this, but it should be easy to extend: \r\n`top_left_border`, `top_border`, `top_right_border`, `right_border`, `bottom_right_border`, `bottom_border`, `bottom_left_border`, `left_border`, `top_title`, `bottom_title`, `winbar`, `vertsplit`, `horsplit`. \r\n\r\nThings like the number and sign columns could also be reported.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if should be an array or not, in that case the we could have `[top_border, left_border]` instead of `top_left_border`. And the title bar would be both `[top_border, title_bar]`. The advantage of this is that it's more flexible, and it's easier to extend in the future, for example if we add some resize handle to the floating windows, then it could be `[right_border, bottom_border, resize_handle]`. Where client that don't handle the resize handle would still probably work correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter writing that out, I definitely think I will go with the array variation, since there does not seem to be any drawbacks. \r\n\r\nNOTE: The type of the border for example can be inferred from the actual cell content, which is useful for clients that wants to render the borders in a more native way and fall back to a character border when it's unknown or unhandled. This is not something that has properly been possible before, since it was not easy to know if a window has a border or not. There's as far as I know, not even an event to subscribe to when the window option changes in either the UI protocol or outside it, so it would have to be polled.\r\n\r\nI also think that the following can be resolved once this is implemented.\r\n* https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27181\r\n\r\nWe could specify that the UI should always report the target window for the mouse clicks, so ignore unfocusable ones and see through window borders. I actually think that works without further code changes on the Neovim side at all.\r\n",
