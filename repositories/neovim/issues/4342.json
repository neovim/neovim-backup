The command is configured via `init.vim` with the default being something like `xterm -e nvim <state token>`.\n\n(If you wanted to be smarter about it, there's an `xdg-terminal` companion to `xdg-open` which apparently just needs a little maintainership to graduate into being part of the `xdg-utils` tarballs.)\n\nOn my system, I'd probably set it to `screen nvim <state token>` since I use GNU screen to implement tabbing in my urxvt_kuake terminal.\n\nIf someone wanted a more traditional GUI, they could use something like `urxvt -name neovim -e nvim <state token>` or, with appropriate adjustments to neovim-qt, `nvim-qt <state token>`.\n",
