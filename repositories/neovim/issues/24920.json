If they're implemented in the naive way, to just repeat the commands input by the user there might be some ways to optimize them:\r\n\r\n1. Eliminate no-ops. For example, repeated esc, j followed by a k, etc.\r\n2. A macro compiler that turns macros into the native movements or something like that. Resolve what the movements will be ahead of time instead of having to pass through the whole input decoding and mapping (I've no idea how vim works)\r\n",

This allows to track all possible changes in bookmarks, jump list, change list, undo list etc.etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is some price in performance to pay. However, mappings are not THAT slow. At least, try to do `set lazyredraw` first, as the screen redraw tends to be the most time consuming part by margin. Yet another typical problem is the misuse of `set clipboard=unnamedplus` option that may severely affect the performance. Just avoid it.\r\n\r\nThat should be enough in most cases but if it still looks too slow then switch to pure scripting. Even legacy VimL should give a very decent performance boost.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, after \"optimization\" the mappings would inevitably lose their \"true evaluation\" feature. And then an enormous heap of incompatibilities and bugs would appear.",

            "body": "@oriongonza It would be nice to clarify, do you mean \"raw\" performance of macros in nvim without any configuration or are we talking about the performance of macros with syntax highlighting enabled (for example treesitter), lsp and additional plugins in general?\n\nI ask because I recently learned that plugins can greatly affect the speed of macro execution. And all because, as I understand, tools like treesitter and lsp actually work with every change in the text in most cases, and as you can imagine, when executing a macro, there are a lot of such changes.\n\nIn my case, I found this great plugin: https://github.com/pteroctopus/faster.nvim \nIt disables all these additional features of the editor for the duration of the macro execution, which in my case increased the speed of macro execution to more than acceptable speed!\n\nIf you are not sure whether your problem is related to plugins or not, you can test it as follows: try opening a file with the following command `nvim -u none filename` and execute your \"slow macro\", comparing it speed execution with the speed you usually experience. If you notice an improvement, I think faster.nvim is what you need.\n\nAlso, if it's really the case and lsp can slow down macro execution, since lsp is built-in feature of nvim i guess we can make argument, that at least in some cases like this nvim could try implement this optimization, i guess.",
