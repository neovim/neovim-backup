If they're implemented in the naive way, to just repeat the commands input by the user there might be some ways to optimize them:\r\n\r\n1. Eliminate no-ops. For example, repeated esc, j followed by a k, etc.\r\n2. A macro compiler that turns macros into the native movements or something like that. Resolve what the movements will be ahead of time instead of having to pass through the whole input decoding and mapping (I've no idea how vim works)\r\n",

This allows to track all possible changes in bookmarks, jump list, change list, undo list etc.etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is some price in performance to pay. However, mappings are not THAT slow. At least, try to do `set lazyredraw` first, as the screen redraw tends to be the most time consuming part by margin. Yet another typical problem is the misuse of `set clipboard=unnamedplus` option that may severely affect the performance. Just avoid it.\r\n\r\nThat should be enough in most cases but if it still looks too slow then switch to pure scripting. Even legacy VimL should give a very decent performance boost.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, after \"optimization\" the mappings would inevitably lose their \"true evaluation\" feature. And then an enormous heap of incompatibilities and bugs would appear.",
