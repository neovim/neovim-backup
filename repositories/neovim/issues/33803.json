I would prefer if it didn't overwrite `.` too.\n\n## Use case\n\nFor the average user there's no use case.\n\nBut it might be very useful for plugin developers.\n\nCurrently there's no way to get the height of wrapped lines. By formatting the text in a hidden buffer it's possible to estimate the correct height(and it will also work with virtual text, if you turn them into normal text and add them to the text).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nHave a `:format` command. It might be a good idea to also support ranges.",
