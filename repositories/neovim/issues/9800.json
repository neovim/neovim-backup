Now it's always readable, but the tradeoff is that it shows a underline.\r\n\r\nI guess now we need a `CursorLineDiff` highlight group as promised in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9028#discussion_r236479290",

Re: the comment in #9028, I count myself among the unknown number of people who consider it worse to have an underline, and I imagine you could roughly guess at this group's membership based on the existing `CursorLine` highlight settings. (It's possible that this isn't doable for underlying architectural reasons but if so I'd be interested to understand why).",
