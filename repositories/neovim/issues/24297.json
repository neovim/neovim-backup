This code is from the original vim, commenting it out didn't seem to break any old tests and I couldn't track down where this was introduced to understand why exactly it is there. A couple of current functional tests rely on this behavior though. And I believe simply removing it is not an option, so how could we approach this?\r\n\r\nIt could probably be solved by either introducing some flag telling that cursor should not be moved or writing invalid cursor position, which would indicate the same. And then use that from `nvim_buf_set_text`, which is used for lsp formatting. Though both of these solutions seem quite ugly. Are there any other solutions I might be missing?",

Moving cursor by how line count above cursor changed after undo still makes sense, just without pulling it exactly to the lowest line number.

It may occur more often for javascript if e.g. you're doing an auto-import which inserts something like `import fs from \"fs\"` and formatter changes double quotes to single quotes, or may be adjusts spaces inside curly or something like that. Or in cases where formatter sends the whole buffer content as a replacement. In my case it was often caused by `esilnt-plugin-simple-import-sort`. I guess python simply doesn't have anything to format in imports, but I may be wrong, I don't code in python.\r\n\r\nIn any case cursor will basically just jump to the top-most change after undoing formatting done by `vim.buf.lsp.format`.",
