The current directory\t\t\t\t*current-directory*\r\n\r\nYou can use |:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| to change to another directory, so you\r\nwill not have to type that directory name in front of the file names.  It also\r\nmakes a difference for executing external commands, e.g. \":!ls\" or \":te ls\".\r\n\r\nThere are three current-directory \"scopes\": global, tab and window.  The\r\nwindow-local working directory takes precedence over the tab-local\r\nworking directory, which in turn takes precedence over the global\r\nworking directory.  If a local working directory (tab or window) does not\r\nexist, the next-higher scope in the hierarchy applies.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo is the patch here just:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetcwd([{winnr}[, {tabnr}]])\t\t\t\t*getcwd()*\r\n\t\tWith no arguments the result is a String, which is the name of\r\n\t\tthe current **global** working directory. With {winnr} or\r\n\t\t{tabnr} the working directory of that scope is returned.\r\n\t\tTabs and windows are identified by their respective numbers,\r\n\t\t0 means current tab or window. Missing argument implies 0.\r\n\t\tThus the following are equivalent: >\r\n\t\t\tgetcwd()\r\n\t\t\tgetcwd(0)\r\n\t\t\tgetcwd(0, 0)\r\n<\t\tIf {winnr} is -1 it is ignored, only the tab is resolved.\r\n\t\t{winnr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems that `global` has precedent over `effective`, and I don't think saying `which is the name of the current effective global working directory` adds much?\r\n\r\nDoes this have to be sent upstream?",
