The current directory\t\t\t\t*current-directory*\r\n\r\nYou can use |:cd|, |:tcd| and |:lcd| to change to another directory, so you\r\nwill not have to type that directory name in front of the file names.  It also\r\nmakes a difference for executing external commands, e.g. \":!ls\" or \":te ls\".\r\n\r\nThere are three current-directory \"scopes\": global, tab and window.  The\r\nwindow-local working directory takes precedence over the tab-local\r\nworking directory, which in turn takes precedence over the global\r\nworking directory.  If a local working directory (tab or window) does not\r\nexist, the next-higher scope in the hierarchy applies.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo is the patch here just:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetcwd([{winnr}[, {tabnr}]])\t\t\t\t*getcwd()*\r\n\t\tWith no arguments the result is a String, which is the name of\r\n\t\tthe current **global** working directory. With {winnr} or\r\n\t\t{tabnr} the working directory of that scope is returned.\r\n\t\tTabs and windows are identified by their respective numbers,\r\n\t\t0 means current tab or window. Missing argument implies 0.\r\n\t\tThus the following are equivalent: >\r\n\t\t\tgetcwd()\r\n\t\t\tgetcwd(0)\r\n\t\t\tgetcwd(0, 0)\r\n<\t\tIf {winnr} is -1 it is ignored, only the tab is resolved.\r\n\t\t{winnr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems that `global` has precedent over `effective`, and I don't think saying `which is the name of the current effective global working directory` adds much?\r\n\r\nDoes this have to be sent upstream?",

In other words, the answer of \"Who's responsible for the directory/path for all upcoming Ex-commands?\" is *the current directory*. By this reasoning, all these wordings are redundant by my standard: (feel free to criticize)\n\n* the current \"effective\" working directory (Bram's kindness)\n* the current \"global\" working directory (Embedding the answer \"the global directory\" into the noun)\n* the current \"effective\" \"global\" working directory (Embedding both Bram's kindness and the answer into the noun)\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not very happy with the term \"working directory\". There is no single mention of \"working directory\" under _**Vim**_'s `:h current-directory`. To see the difference, run the following in both `vim` & `nvim`:\n\n```\n:h current-directory\n/working\n```\n\nTo me, the most concise version is \"the current directory\".
