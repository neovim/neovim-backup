See the discussion here https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/1790, between me an @A-Lamia for example. There was also some discussions in the Neovide discord channel with @TheSast.\r\n\r\nI think there are two main problems at the moment.\r\n1. The highlight group `blend` only applies to floating windows. so it's not possible to customize parts of the main ui like the main background and the status bar. This might only be a documentation issue though\r\n> blend={integer}\t\t\t\t\thighlight-blend\r\n\tOverride the blend level for a highlight group within the popupmenu\r\n\tor floating windows. Only takes effect if ['pumblend'](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'pumblend') or ['winblend'](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'winblend')\r\n\tis set for the menu or window. See the help at the respective option.\r\n2. There's no way to set blend for the foreground color. Probably the biggest use case for this is to make the statusbar fully transparent, since some of the \"background\" colors are often done with characters using foreground colors\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe transparency is configurable for all visible elements.",

Introduce `blendfg` and `blendbg`, which applies to the background and the foreground color respectively\n2. `blend` is deprectated for backwards compatibility and works the same way as currently, but `blendbg` always takes priority if both are specified\n3. `winblend` and `pumblend` only sets the defaults for `blendbg`, when it's not specified and never toggles the blending on/off for hightlight groups that sets it\n4. `blendfg` and `blendbg` applies to all windows, both floating and regular ones\n\nNOTE. `blendbg` and `blendfg` might not be implementable in the TUI currently. But for example the [Kitty Protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/protocol-extensions/) could probably be extended with support for it. In any case it does not break anything if not supported, since it's just affects the desktop visibility through the background.",
