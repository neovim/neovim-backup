See the discussion here https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/1790, between me an @A-Lamia for example. There was also some discussions in the Neovide discord channel with @TheSast.\r\n\r\nI think there are two main problems at the moment.\r\n1. The highlight group `blend` only applies to floating windows. so it's not possible to customize parts of the main ui like the main background and the status bar. This might only be a documentation issue though\r\n> blend={integer}\t\t\t\t\thighlight-blend\r\n\tOverride the blend level for a highlight group within the popupmenu\r\n\tor floating windows. Only takes effect if ['pumblend'](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'pumblend') or ['winblend'](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'winblend')\r\n\tis set for the menu or window. See the help at the respective option.\r\n2. There's no way to set blend for the foreground color. Probably the biggest use case for this is to make the statusbar fully transparent, since some of the \"background\" colors are often done with characters using foreground colors\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe transparency is configurable for all visible elements.",

            "body": "This has also been discussed here:\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/31737\n\nI think the easiest way to implement this without introducing breaking changes is the following:\n1. Introduce `blendfg` and `blendbg`, which applies to the background and the foreground color respectively. `blendfg`  blends through the current window to the layer below, just like `blendbg`. \n2. `blend` is deprectated for backwards compatibility and works the same way as currently, but `blendbg` always takes priority if both are specified\n3. `winblend` and `pumblend` only sets the defaults for `blendbg`, when the latter is unspecified and never toggles the blending on/off for hightlight groups that sets it\n4. `blendfg` and `blendbg` applies to all windows, both floating and regular ones\n5. At least two layers are supported; the top-level windows and floating windows, just like the TUI does it today. That means that when multiple floating windows are on top of each other, only the highlight from the topmost one is used, and you will see through all the rest, blending against the background below the floating windows. This makes it much easier to build complex UI, and that way of doing things is widely in use today by plugins. As an extension, UIs can decide to support several layers, based on the zindex, so that all windows with the same zindex blends through to the zindex below. That is supported by Neovide today and probably tricky or impossible to implement for the TUI when there are multiple transparent layers on top of each other.\n\nNOTE. `blendbg` and `blendfg` might not be implementable in the TUI currently for non-floating windows. But for example the [Kitty Protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/protocol-extensions/) could probably be extended with support for it. In any case it does not break anything if not supported, since it's just affecting the desktop visibility through the background.",

I'm not sure exactly what's needed, and what's too complex. But at least per cell control of the background color transparency seems like something that could potentially be implemented, similar to this https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#the-color-table\n\nNot likely to happen anytime soon, it would be a big performance hit,\nessentially bg colors would need to be become 32bit from 24bit currently.\nThis has all sorts of non-local performance effects. Colors currently\nare stored in 25 bits the extra bit is used to flag color table colors,\nso to accommodate alpha one would need to either limit it to 7 bits or\nbump up bg colors to 64 bits. And anyway IMO HDR colors (aka 10 bits per\nchannel) is both a more important and less invasive change.\n\nNote that in kitty you can set and control the opacity of upto 8\nbackground colors, but definitely not per cell. That is more than\nsufficient for most use cases, but it *does not* work for foreground\ncolors used as backgrounds via powerline type symbols.\n\nSee https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/color-stack/#setting-and-querying-colors\nlook for transparent_background_colors.\n\nIn theory I could add 8 transparent_foreground_colors as well, but not\ntoo keen. IMO powerline sections shouldn't be transparent anyway, they\nshow supposedly important information.\n\nThough if one really wants too, the solution for powerline type symbols\nis really to stop using text symbols for them and instead draw them as\nbitmaps sized to the cell and use the graphics protocol, to place them\nunder the text, then you have perfect control over their transparency.\n\nAs for the general problem of blending popups and UI elements, the\nsolution for that is for terminals to implement native popup windows\nthe terminal programs wont need hacks to implement it. This is on my\nTODO list and I already have a spec mostly designed for it in my head,\nwatch the kitty issues for an RFC when I have something more concrete.\n",
