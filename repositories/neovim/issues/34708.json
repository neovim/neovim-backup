Examples:\n- `vim.version.range('<=1.2.3')` includes pre-releases of 1.2.4.\n- `vim.version.range('<=1.2.3-alpha')` includes 1.2.3.\n- `vim.version.range('<=1.2.3-beta')` includes 1.2.4-alpha.\n\nThis is because version ranges are right-side-exclusive and '<=a.b.c' ranges are implemented by increase patch number by 1.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. `nvim --clean`\n2. All of the following should return `false`, but they return `true`:\n    - `:=vim.version.range('<=1.2.3'):has('1.2.4-alpha')`\n    - `:=vim.version.range('<=1.2.3-alpha'):has('1.2.3')`\n    - `:=vim.version.range('<=1.2.3-beta'):has('1.2.4-alpha')`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nVersion range '<=a.b.c' is treated as \"less or equal to 'a.b.c'\" and never includes versions that are strictly greater than 'a.b.c'.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-690+gc752016976\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, doesn't have this functionality\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nEndeavourOS Linux x86_64\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGhostty 1.1.3-arch1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom source",

Those results don't contradict anything and are expected.\n\nVersion range '>=a.b.c' should represent *all* versions 'd.e.f' for which `'d.e.f >= a.b.c` is true and *only* them. Since `'1.2.4-alpha' >= '1.2.3' is true (even stronger comparison with `>` is true, but that is not the point here), it should be inside '>=1.2.3' range.\n\nSimilar definition is for '>a.b.c', '<a.b.c', and '<=a.b.c'. But on current `master` it is not always true:\n- '>1.2.3' doesn't include '1.2.4-alpha', although `'1.2.4-alpha > '1.2.3'` is true.\n- '<=1.2.3' includes '1.2.4-alpha', although `'1.2.4-alpha' <= '1.2.3'` is false. By the way, this is true on `master`, but not on 0.11.2.\n\n> I think it may be better if `vim.version.range()` keeps the comparison signs in its parsing result (as `cmp_from` and `cmp_to` for example), so we don't have to modify `from` and `to`, which could be error-prone. That could also save us from having to sort `from` and `to`\n\nAlthough I don't disagree that it is more robust for version range to include info about edge inclusivity, this quite significantly complicates interface. As there needs to be a way to create any kind of finite range from string, using just `a.b.c - d.e.f` notation is not enough and it would require accepting/parsing something like `>a.b.c - <=d.e.f.`. Although after #34715 there will be `vim.version.intersect()` to construct this kind of ranges, storing edge inclusivity still poses problems for `tostring()` method.\n\nThe solution in #34715 of using the lowest available pre-release version (i.e. `0`) seems to be pretty good and (based on tests) is very close to being a proper one.",
