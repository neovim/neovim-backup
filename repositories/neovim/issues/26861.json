Plugins may cause performance issues and troubleshooting this requires external platform-specific tools (gdb/lldb/etc).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNvim should have a global \"jobs\" table that provides visibility into:\n\n- recent jobs (including terminated jobs)\n- job info (start/end times, plugin/source-line that invoked it)\n\nThis table should be updated whenever a process is started by:\n\n```\nsystem()\njobstart()\nvim.system()\n:terminal\nnvim_open_term()\nvim.uv.spawn (if reasonably feasible)\n```\n\n`:checkhealth job` should show a warning if a plugin is causing performance degradation because of expensive or numerous processes.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHooking into `uv_spawn` would be the most comprehensive way to capture all jobs. But the higher-level info (such as plugin source-line) would need to be plumbed through, where possible.\n\n### Related\n\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25914\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19624\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/557",
