    "body": "### Problem\n\n`takewhile` and `dropwhile` are common patterns in functional programming that allow users to take/skip elements from an iterator as long as a given predicate holds true.\n\nOne useful use case is to trim leading whitespace while preserving character column indices, after getting a line from buffer:\n\n```lua\nvim\n  .iter(ipairs(vim.split(vim.fn.getline '.', '')))\n  :skip(function(_, char) return char:match '%s' end)\n  :totable()\n```\n\nYet `vim.iter` API currently lacks such correspondence, and the equivalent logic has to be constructed manually.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI propose adding `takewhile` and `dropwhile` patterns to `vim.iter` by extending `Iter:take` and `Iter:skip` to accept a predicate function in addition to an integer.\n\n* When `iter:take` takes a predicate function as an argument, it will iterate through the sequence, yielding elements from the pipeline for which the predicate returns `true`. Once the predicate returns `false` for an element, or upon reaching the end, stop advancing and discard the rest of elements.\n* When `iter:skip` takes a predicate function as an argument, it will iterate through the sequence, discarding elements from the pipeline for which the predicate returns `true`. Once the predicate returns `false` for an element, or upon reaching the end, stop advancing and yield the remaining elements as an iterator.",
