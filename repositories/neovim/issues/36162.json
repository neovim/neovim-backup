Is it expected that all plugins which didn't need an update have empty lockfile entries?",

But if you'd expect deleted lockfile to be remade only after `vim.pack.udpate()` - probably not the biggest issue usually. But if there are 50+ plugins - it might be.\n\nIt probably is best to decide the boundaries of how robust this is expected to be. For example:\n- Should lockfile structure be validated on every startup (i.e. in first `vim.pack.add()` call)? And should it be restored immediately (with or without a warning) or should there be only warning.\n- Or should it be fully validated (and/or repaired) before every time the file is written to the disk?\n\nThe current design is to choose to be less invasive and suggest to run `:checkhealth vim.pack`. It will then check the validity of the lockfile and suggest further actions.",
