This issue is not really a feature request, but rather a follow-up to [Neovim built-in options survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/z1tmjg/neovim_builtin_options_survey_needs_your/) I conducted for the past two weeks and a place to discuss its results. I decided to create this mainly because @justinmk [expressed an openness](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/z1tmjg/comment/ixfp0gn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for looking into it once it is over.\r\n\r\nHere is [a gist with full results](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/fa70dc75c475369747d2a485a13303fb) along with description of how to read them and scripts used. Total number of legible answers were 227. Analysis was done with R, script is in the gist. I decided to not make initial answers public, but if anyone from Neovim core wants to look at them, I'll send them by e-mail or open access to a Google Form (needs Google account).\r\n\r\nHere is a plot with summary of basic options usage (options were picked by hand):\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Basic options summary plot</summary>\r\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24854248/206497986-2a4079e8-7ed0-49c0-8f62-ca4543b16f1d.png\"></img>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nHere is a table with top non-default option values:\r\n\r\n| Option         | Value                   | Number of answers | Percent |\r\n|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------|\r\n| termguicolors  | true                    | 216               | 95%     |\r\n| helplang       | en                      | 200               | 88%     |\r\n| number         | true                    | 196               | 86%     |\r\n| expandtab      | true                    | 187               | 83%     |\r\n| ignorecase     | true                    | 185               | 81%     |\r\n| smartcase      | true                    | 183               | 81%     |\r\n| splitright     | true                    | 161               | 71%     |\r\n| splitbelow     | true                    | 155               | 68%     |\r\n| cursorline     | true                    | 150               | 66%     |\r\n| leader         | \\<Space>                | 150               | 66%     |\r\n| undofile       | true                    | 147               | 65%     |\r\n| relativenumber | true                    | 135               | 59%     |\r\n| mouse          | a                       | 132               | 58%     |\r\n| showmode       | false                   | 129               | 57%     |\r\n| statusline     | %#Normal#               | 126               | 56%     |\r\n| laststatus     | 3                       | 123               | 54%     |\r\n| signcolumn     | yes                     | 106               | 47%     |\r\n| wrap           | false                   | 105               | 46%     |\r\n| tabstop        | 4                       | 103               | 45%     |\r\n| clipboard      | unnamedplus             | 101               | 44%     |\r\n| list           | true                    | 101               | 44%     |\r\n| shiftwidth     | 4                       | 101               | 45%     |\r\n| shiftwidth     | 2                       | 96                | 42%     |\r\n| showtabline    | 2                       | 96                | 42%     |\r\n| smartindent    | true                    | 94                | 41%     |\r\n| tabstop        | 2                       | 91                | 40%     |\r\n| linebreak      | true                    | 78                | 34%     |\r\n| breakindent    | true                    | 67                | 30%     |\r\n| softtabstop    | 4                       | 64                | 28%     |\r\n| lazyredraw     | true                    | 60                | 26%     |\r\n| updatetime     | 300                     | 60                | 27%     |\r\n| completeopt    | \"menu,menuone,noselect\" | 57                | 25%     |\r\n\r\nNote: `helplang=\"en\"` is a part of result because default value is described as \"messages language or empty\", but `vim.api.nvim_get_option_info('helplang')` returns only `\"\"` as default.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that there is quite a few basic options which are used with non-default values. For completeness, here are some possible pitfalls of this survey:\r\n\r\n- Not *that* large sample size (227). Maybe this survey will prompt Neovim core to make their own, official so to speak, poll.\r\n- Possible sampling bias due survey procedure (user needed to download script, execute it, and post results), which *might* poorly represent not so tech-savvy users.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that all boolean option values with 80% here seem like widespread enough to become default. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading this!",

The default value of `expandtab` is (mostly) meaningless because that should be set by individual filetype plugins. That really just leaves `number`, `ignorecase`, and `smartcase` for consideration.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I'm not in favor of changing any of these. In particular, enabling `ignorecase` and `smartcase` violates the principle of least surprise. It's fine if someone enables those options understanding what they do, but as default behavior it could be surprising or unexpected (as another point of reference, other standard tools that perform \"search\" such as `grep` or `less` do not ignore case by default either). I'm more ambivalent about `number`; I don't personally use it, but I don't have a very strong argument against it. Just preference.\r\n\r\nThat's my 2c.\r\n",

I think this is a great survey, but I suspect quite a big bias here due to the selection of of the respondents. \r\n> Possible sampling bias due survey procedure (user needed to download script, execute it, and post results), which might poorly represent not so tech-savvy users\r\n\r\nNot just that - people who take such serveys are already active & involved users of nvim. The survey was posted on reddit, on a subreddit dedicated to neovim - it's a very specific audience, not representing your average nvim user. No way 59% of regular nvim users - or, honestly, even 20 - use relativenumber. (although I don't have any data to prove my suspicion).\r\n\r\nFWIW, last point I'd like to make, is that I think there are two kinds of people\r\n- Those who use the default config or just have a couple of lines in it\r\n- Those who extensively tweak nvim\r\nAnd imo, the first group is rather conservative, so they'd be annoyed by a sudden change of behaviour, while the second group can tweak it all either way, regarldess of the defaults.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have no data, these are my thoughts",

Itâ€™s been a minor annoyance to me for a long time that these themes, which I never use, clutter up my theme list, and there is no straightforward way of removing them.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would be in favor of removing those themes from the default install. If there are people who really miss them could always reinstall them manually. I think those themes may also contribute to the perception that \"Vim is ugly\".",
