Blame him! j/k\nSecond, I'm hesitant to submit this, as this is not a high priority imo and seemingly something the maintainers have not wanted to implement in the past.\nThird, I don't think neovim needs to implement this the same way vim does, but it would be quite nice to have.\n\nThe first thing I think would be useful is a `:sterminal` command that splits the window (like :new, :split, :sbuffer, etc instead of :edit, :buffer). I have some `cabbrev` hacks replace `:term` and `:vterm` (at the beginning of the command-line only), but it would be nice to have first-class split terminals like `:sterm` and `:vert sterm`\n\nThe second, more important feature for anyone who uses a terminal in a split, would be to have something that mimics 'termwinkey' (vim's 'termwinkey'). There is `<C-\\><C-o>`, but this can't be paired easily with `<C-w>` because it `:startinsert`s in the next window if you move to another window. Also, `wincmd`-ing back to the terminal window does not `:startinsert` to start terminal mode.\n\nI actually made this plugin years ago (some convoluted bug fixes (when you go from a term win to another term win, it `:stopinsert`s incorrectly) were lost and I lost motivation to figure it out again): https://github.com/VioletJewel/vimterm.nvim/tree/main\n\nIt implements this 'termwinkey' for neovim, but it is a ***huge*** hack. Tweaking the source code even a little can lock up neovim completely. I discussed this with Justin (I think) a couple of years ago on matrix, and he seemed amenable. I know there are plenty of other high priority things to accomplish, however!\n\nBfredl says that perhaps we should improve `<C-\\><C-o>`, so it \"observes\" window changes and \"remembers\" (on `autocmd {'BufWinEnter','WinEnter','CmdlineLeave'}` perhaps) to re-start terminal mode with `:startinsert`. I am of the opinion that a proper 'termwinkey' would be nice because `<C-bslash><C-o>` works \"correctly\" from my understanding. I am also not picky.\n\nI've never helped in vim's/neovim's source code. Maybe I should try my hand, though I have enough on my plate already and am scared of failing! Plus, this seems like a very difficult problem to solve for a variety of reasons.\n\nThanks,\nvi6\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nn/a\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n1. from a terminal in terminal mode, `<C-w>p` (or `<C-bslash><C-o><C-w><C-p>`) goes to the other non-terminal window and is in normal mode\n2. from a terminal in terminal mode, `<C-w><C-p><C-w><C-p>` leaves the terminal window, moves to the other buffer, starts normal mode there (if it's not another terminal window), moves back to the terminal window, and does `:startinsert` to resume terminal mode.\n\nThis will allow for people to use terminals in split windows!\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-1264+g19ba589946\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nvim has 'termwinkey'\n\n### Operating system/version\n\narch\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nst\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nst-256color\n\n### Installation\n\naur",
