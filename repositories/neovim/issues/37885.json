    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen attempting to build Neovim for WebAssembly using Emscripten, the dependency build fails during luv configuration with:\n\n<img width=\"931\" height=\"141\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/503942b7-f5d3-488d-8d5e-98c76c9e577b\" />\n\nThis occurs even though LibUV builds successfully earlier in the process.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen trying to run make deps with Emscripten, LibUV is built first and installed to .deps/usr/lib/libuv.a as a WebAssembly compiled library. However, when luv begins its configuration, it searches for LibUV in standard system paths like /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib. These system paths compiled for the host system, not WebAssembly libraries. The build system is cross compiling, so these native libraries are incompatible and should not be used, but CMake doesn't know that, so it simply fails when it cannot find a suitable LibUV in the system paths.\n\nWithout explicit LIBUV_INCLUDE_DIR and LIBUV_LIBRARY paths being passed to luv's CMake configuration, the FindLibuv.cmake module cannot locate the cross compiled library. This is why native builds work fine, but WebAssembly builds fail. So, what I am proposed is to modify `cmake.deps/cmake/BuildLuv.cmake` to pass LibUV paths in this case. \n\nIf the proposed approach and explanation are correct, I could submit a PR.",
