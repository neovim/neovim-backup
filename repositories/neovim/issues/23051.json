    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim's [current benchmarks](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/master/test/benchmark) are weak.\r\n\r\nNot having a comprehensive set of benchmarks limits our visibility into performance regressions and places to make performance wins.\r\n\r\nI want to use this issue as a place to begin discussing a plan to _slowly_ start adding benchmarks for Neovim's core features.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI want us to invest in basic benchmarks.  Here are some ideas on where to start benchmarking:\r\n\r\n- neovim cold-start time with no file (`nvim`)\r\n- neovim start time with a large file\r\n- syntax highlighting speed\r\n- vimscript performance\r\n- lua API performance (a script that interacts heavily with neovim APIs)\r\n\r\nI was disappointed by the attitude in #23028 which was (strawman)\r\n\r\n> 🤷‍♀️ well it's probably faster so why not?\r\n\r\nFor #23028 it would have been very helpful if we just had a few basic benchmarks.  Another reason having benchmarks is nice is because it lets us highlight performance **wins**.  We cannot add an entry to [This Week in Neovim](https://this-week-in-neovim.org/) for [f4136c9](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/f4136c9d42f79c0f2fe3ce6fdc22b1544593692a) because there's nothing to say.  If, on the other hand we could show that `-O3` resulted in a 5% performance increase for opening large files that would be great marketing!  We should also invest in writing comprehensive benchmarks so we can highlight performance wins to the community 🙂 ",

That is why in my most recent message I considered that I am getting too worked up and that Neovim doesn't need benchmarks since it's done fine without them so far.  I guess the intuition of contributors like you is sufficient to make sure Neovim stays fast without needing to ever measure anything.\r\n\r\n> But yes, our benchmarking is weak and needs work :)\r\n\r\nI agree it would be better if we had better benchmarking.  However now I've sorta done a 180 on my opinion.  Does our benchmarking \"need\" work?  Neovim has been fast for the last decade without writing any comprehensive benchmarks",
