The reason is that command-line, just like interactive ex mode, uses a completely isolated mechanism for input and redraw, and making that play nicely with msgpack-rpc redraw events could be very challenging\n\nBefore evolving the discussion, what do you guys think of this:\n\n``` vim\nfunction! SetupCommandLine()\n  if exists('g:enhanced_command_line')\n    inoremap <buffer> <silent> <esc> <esc>:q<cr>\n  endif\nendfunction\n\nfunction! TeardownCommandLine()\n  if exists('g:enhanced_command_line')\n    iunmap <buffer> <silent> <esc>\n  endif\n  unlet g:enhanced_command_line\nendfunction\n\nau CmdwinEnter * call SetupCommandLine()\nau CmdwinLeave * call TeardownCommandLine()\nnnoremap <silent> : :let g:enhanced_command_line = 1<cr>q:i\n```\n\nCurrently we can't make the command window a full replacement for the command line(see `:help command-line-window` for limitations), but I'm showing this because it has crossed my mind the idea of making command line just a special mode of the command-window. Advantages of this:\n- Simplification(one less mode the editor can be in)\n- Remove a lot of code in favor of reusing existing facilities to achieve the same funcitonality\n- Make the command-line more easily customizable\n- Transparent integration with UIs over msgpack-rpc\n\nAny thoughts? I'm interested in reading what @ZyX-I thinks of this(especially possible implications)\n",

And that command window's insert mode is able to completely emulate previous command mode, completions and all.\n\nThats what I have been imagining, though it is already possible to use completion in the command window(did you try pressing TAB in insert mode? it shows a insert-mode menu with the completions you would get in the command line). The only thing it is not emulated in command window insert mode is history search(with `<up>`/`<down>` with what has been typed so far\n\n> Then, I would have my problems solved. Normal mode in command line just pressing esc. And command completion in command window. What do you think?\n\nNot sure if we should change the default behavior of the command line(eg: make <esc> go into normal mode) because existing mappings may depend on it. What you desire is already possible though, you can simply remap `<esc>` in the command line, something like `cnoremap <esc> <c-f>`\n\nHere's an improved version of the previous snippet, this one makes sure normal command window isn't affected:\n\n``` vim\nfunction! EnableImprovedCommandLine()\n  nnoremap <silent> : :let g:improved_command_line = 1<cr>q:i\nendfunction\n\nfunction! DisableImprovedCommandLine()\n  nunmap :\nendfunction\n\nfunction! SetupImprovedCommandLine()\n  if exists('g:improved_command_line')\n    inoremap <buffer> <silent> <esc> <esc>:q<cr>\n  else\n    call DisableImprovedCommandLine()\n  endif\nendfunction\n\nfunction! TeardownImprovedCommandLine()\n  if exists('g:improved_command_line')\n    iunmap <buffer> <esc>\n    unlet g:improved_command_line\n  else\n    call EnableImprovedCommandLine()\n  endif\nendfunction\n\nau CmdwinEnter * call SetupImprovedCommandLine()\nau CmdwinLeave * call TeardownImprovedCommandLine()\ncall EnableImprovedCommandLine()\n```\n",

So, I understand we would be emulating command mode reusing implementation of insert mode, but not dropping conceptual command mode. \n\nBut then, how would things like command mode mappings work? I suppose a command mode mapping would translate into an insert mode mapping restricted to a particular buffer (command line buffer). Am I right? Do you preview any difficulties down that path?\n",

For now I need to implement split handling, but I haven't done it because statusline and tabline seem to work differently from each other. Here's a gif that shows what I mean:\r\n\r\n![split](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7888397/89704665-40f7ee00-d92c-11ea-868f-019d40bbe450.gif)\r\n\r\nSo what I mean is that when performing the `:split` command, Neovim creates an independent statusline for each split buffer, but keeps the same tabline. I know there must be a reason for this, but it would really improve the next version of my plugin if the user had the option of disabling the creation of a separate statusline for each split. \r\n\r\nThe way the plugin already works is this. By creating a project file such as\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-08-08 04-08-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7888397/89704722-d1cec980-d92c-11ea-91a5-27191484806d.png)\r\n\r\nNVPM then renders the statusline to show the buffer-list created in the project file as shown in the code snippet above. The tabline, on the other hand, will render both the workspace list and the tablist. \r\n\r\nIn the next version of NVPM plugin, I intend to implement the feature of creating splits in the project file, such as\r\n\r\n![split](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7888397/89704764-4b66b780-d92d-11ea-8409-5048e11ac9bd.png)\r\n\r\nwhere the user could tell NVPM to split them horizontally or vertically. But it's of great importance if Neovim doesn't create two statuslines for each split, as shown at the end of the gif.\r\n\r\nI don't know how hard would be to implement it or even if it's already possible somehow. Any help?\r\n\r\nwith regards,\r\nItamar Soares",
