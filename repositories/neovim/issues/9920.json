    "body": "First of all, sorry if this has been suggested before, I haven't found anything about it, but there's a lot of issues on here regarding floating windows, and it's a tricky subject to search...\r\n\r\nI recently wrote a short [blog article](https://www.zingiber.nl/blog/hacking-neovims-new-floating-windows/) about a simple, generic workflow tweak that leverages floating window support. In short, I really liked the idea of using floating windows on top of (both literally and figuratively) regular split windows. It would basically allow me to toggle an additional floating window that i could use for whatever buffer (scratch, terminal, any file) I wanted at the time. This allows for a lot of flexibility in my workflow. The article shows a very simple (and quite hacky) plugin, that implemented this the way i pictured it.\r\n\r\nI linked this article on the subreddit, and I was asked to open an issue regarding my suggested workflow. For completeness sake, this is how I described it in the article:\r\n\r\n- one simple keyboard mapping that shows a floating window over all the other split windows\r\n- by default, it will simply show the buffer that was active when using the keyboard mapping\r\n- opening other files, loading other buffers etc. should work the same as always (vim-vinegar is excellent for this)\r\n- this floating window can be closed normally, or by hitting the mapping again\r\n- closing the window won't actually delete the buffer, and when hitting the mapping again, will pull up the buffer you last looked at\r\n",
