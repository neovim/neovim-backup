A lot of configs rely on wildcard patterns to detect `root_dir`.\n\ni.e.\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/b6936cb85d1e95b5ff00016b1185ab1a14450579/lsp/arduino_language_server.lua#L75-L76\n\nIn order to completely remove the `lspconfig.util` module there should be a way to do it natively in `vim.lsp`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI thought about 2 approoaches:\n\n**Leveraging current functionality**\n\nBy looking at neovim's source code, it stood out to me that `root_markers` becomes just `vim.fs.root(bufnr, root_markers)` and this means that it could also be a function (not documented in `vim.lsp` docs, but documented in `vim.fs.root()`)\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/ee3f9a1e03a93ab2a75a6f7a2f3bb2f4c6b4e736/runtime/lua/vim/lsp.lua#L652-L655\n\nSo servers with wildcard patterns might have:\n```lua\n{\n  ...\n  root_markers = function(name, path)\n    local patterns = { \".git\", \"%.ino$\" }\n    for _, pattern in ipairs(patterns) do\n      if name:match(pattern) ~= nil then\n        return true\n      end\n    end\n    return false\n  end,\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nBut I don't know if `\".git\"` should become `\"^%.git$\"` in order to be a more precise match and that would make it quite verbose.\n\n**Built-in support**\n\nA way to check for `*` inside markers in `root_markers` that would trigger the match.",
