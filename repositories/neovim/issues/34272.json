Providing precise repro steps, helps avoid back-and-forth.\n\nAnyway, no, the task is not to fix the 6 individual features you listed. The task is to let buffers return to an actually-empty state, via `u` and `<bs>` and `dd`. The result of `byte2line` et al., is likely all driven by the same internal state. Allowing buffers to again reach that internal actually-empty state will implicitly fix `byte2line` et al.\n\nThe task is not to individually tweak every function like `byte2line`.\n\nDuring this work, it may be discovered that changing this has too much \"blast radius\". We'll need to consider that. But at least then we can clarify the documentation.",
