    "body": "### Problem\n\nCurrently you can launch a remote server with `--headless --listen addr:port`, and later connect an UI like Neovide to it, which is good. But the problem is that Neovim does not wait for the UI to attach and proceeds to load the init files immediately. This is problematic because the user might have conditional customization in the init files, for example `if vim.g.neovide`, which will never run.\r\n\r\nWe, the maintainers of Neovide, have always assumed that `--headless` waits for the UI to attach, so that's what we have been suggesting in the documentation. But as part of investigating bugs like https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/2620, https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/1868 I found that to not be the case. It's also not a bug, since the behaviour is clearly documented in the documentation (but not the commandline help).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/25709 (Neovim 0.10) added support for `--embed --listen addr:port`, which waits for the UI to attach. But that is only suitable as a workaround at best, since it also captures the stdin. Another hacky workaround is to do the GUI specific configuration in `UIEnter`, but that's too late due to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25377, and things like font's should definitely be set before anything is drawn on the screen.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPreferably `--headless --listen addr:port`, should always wait for an UI to attach, at least I can't think of any use cases for the current behavour. \r\n\r\nBut if that's not possible, a new command line parameter should be added to make the startup wait for an UI to attach.",

Right now, it's mostly OK; the checks in the user configuration are not really needed, since Neovide is configured using global variables (https://neovide.dev/configuration.html), so they can be set no matter if Neovide is connected or not. They are typically only needed for doing something else when Neovide is *not* running, or for configuring standard Neovim options based on the configuration.\r\n\r\nBut we probably want to add custom commands and functions that can be run during the configuration stage at some point, perhaps a traditional `setup` function or something else, since the flat variable list is not really extendible enough for what we have been planning. Some options were discussed here https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12544, and they all require that Neovide, or at least some Neovide plugin is running when the init file is parsed. And having a separate plugin that needs to be in sync with Neovide sounds like a nightmare for the users.\r\n\r\nSo as far as I see it, the absolutely cleanest solution is to have a parameter that waits at the startup, just like `--embed` does.

On a philosophical level, I'm against this proposal - as you said in the OP, there's already `UIEnter` to do this, and it's strictly better than setting things in init.vim/init.lua based on whether a global variable is defined, since it'll work when multiple GUIs connect to a same Neovim instance or when a same UI connects and disconnects to the same instance multiple times.\r\n\r\nHowever, on a practical level, I must admit that in my experience users clearly don't understand `UIEnter` and don't want to learn anything more than global variables. Moreover, aside from combining noice.nvim and another GUI, there has been very little use of combined GUIs, despite this being possible since the inception of Neovim's UI protocol. Finally, I must admit that having a better way to delay sourcing of the user's init.vim/init.lua would likely have helped me a lot with Firenvim. So in the end, I'd say this change would indeed be a very worthwhile improvement to Neovim.\r\n\r\nYet another case of worse is better I guess :)",

For example, `lazy.nvim` draws its UI completely before `UIEnter`. Many error messages are also displayed before that. So, if you set for example the `guifont` there, the initial window size and font will be wrong. See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25377\r\n\r\nSo, for this reason in Neovide, we assume that all the options are valid when the screen is drawn for the first time and the first flush message is received. We delay showing our UI window until that point.",

The dictwatcher approach that we are currently using only supports watching at the top level. So, if we want advanced font configuration for example, using user commands or functions like `neovide_set_font()`, then it would not work. More discussion about that here https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12544. \r\n\r\nI'm not very concerned about being able to attach multiple different UIs at this point, especially not of different types. Although it would be nice to have support for that as well. Currently even the simple case of detaching neovide and attaching again is quite broken, much of the multigrid state is not properly synchronized, and I assume that it will take a lot of work to make that possible, let alone attaching several UIs at different times. \r\n\r\n",

It's probably a lot easier to add than to fix `UIEnter`  to be called before anything is drawn.\r\n\r\n>> Currently even the simple case of detaching neovide and attaching again is quite broken, much of the multigrid state is not properly synchronized\r\n>\r\n>Then let's fix that. Meanwhile, I haven't seen any issues with reattaching the TUI (including multiple clients)...\r\n\r\nI will try to write some issues later today. But one of the biggest issues is that we can't render the UI the same way terminal Neovim, due to not having access to the full composition order. This means that we have to emulate it, which can only be done if we receive each window event in the correct order. Here's how it's done https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2612. I briefly mentioned it here as well https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/29135\r\n\r\nThe other, probably easier to fix problem, is that the whole UI state needs to be sent to the UI when it connects. I will give some examples of what's missing when I write the issues.",
