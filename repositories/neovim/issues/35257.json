            "body": "Also noticed this while testing the new `autocomplete` option. This happens because the LSP omnifunc is async, and calls the `complete()` with empty results. There are several ways this could be addressed:\n\n1. Add `on_empty: fun(): void` option to `vim.lsp.completion.enable()` , allowing user to define what they want to do when ther e are no results. This would add flexibility to the user to do whatever they want in that case. To solve this specific issue, returning `false` would just basically do nothing, and let other things to autocomplete. I'd prefer this option since allows for more customization.\n2. Handle the empty results manually, by checking if `complete` has any other options beside `o`, and skip calling `complete()` with empty results.\n\nFrom my testing, just a simple check for empty matches and skipping the call to `complete()` does the trick. I didn't test all the different `complete` options with it though.",

If we can ensure in the script that when the first completion returns empty, subsequent returns (maybe from another client) still belong to the current completion cycle (meanwhile still using the previous startcol), then we can directly call the extended complete_add to populate the results into the doubly linked list, and then refresh the pum content and don't close it.\n\nLSP also supports returning isIncomplete, and subsequent returns' results still belong to the previous startcol. So, the script might need to do some checks, such as checking changedtick and the current isIncomplete value, etc. If we can ensure in the script that subsequent completions belong to the current cycle, then the C code will be simpler.  need to test this further. just my current thinking. 😩",
