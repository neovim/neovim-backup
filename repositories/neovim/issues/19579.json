            "body": "I managed to cross compile neovim 0.9.0 and wanted to share some tips and tricks for others trying to do the same.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n1. I opted to not use the bundled LuaJIT, LuaRocks and LUV. \r\nWhen building the deps folder, pass this to `cmake`: `-DUSE_BUNDLED_LUAJIT=off -DUSE_BUNDLED_LUAROCKS=off -DUSE_BUNDLED_LUV=off`\r\nThis is because cross compiling LuaJIT is difficult when there is a pointer size mismatch between the build platform and the target (it was my case). This is mentioned in passing here: https://luajit.org/install.html#cross.\r\nI was able to find compiled .a files for Luajit 5.1 and libluv 1.44 for my target platform, so I just provided these separately. Plenty of distros have -devel packages for these so it should be easy to find them for your target architecture.\r\n\r\n3. `luajit`, `lua-lpeg`, `lua-mpack` and `nvim` itself are build-time dependencies, so make sure you install them on your build host.\r\n\r\n4. Create a CMake toolchain file and pass it to `cmake` as described here: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Cross%20Compiling%20With%20CMake.html#toolchain-files\r\nUse `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` to reference the location(s) of the luajit and libluv target files.\r\nUse `set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)` to prevent cmake from trying to run compiled targets from the build environment. \r\n \r\n5.  Finally, addressing @Mic92 comment above, the following two  `CMakeLists.txt` directly invoke the freshly built `nvim` binary. This obviously won't work if the build platform is incompatible with the target platform.\r\n\r\nIn src/nvim/po/CMakeLists.txt:\r\n`COMMAND $<TARGET_FILE:nvim> ` should be replaced by `COMMAND nvim`\r\n\r\nIn runtime/CMakeLists.txt:\r\n`COMMAND \"${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin/nvim\"` should be replaced by `COMMAND nvim`\r\n\r\nI believe using the target name (ie: `nvim` here) is the proper way to do it because the CMake documentation says:\r\n\r\n> If COMMAND specifies an executable target name (created by the [add_executable()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.22/command/add_executable.html#command:add_executable) command), it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time if either of the following is true:\r\n> - The target is not being cross-compiled (i.e. the [CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.22/variable/CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING.html#variable:CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) variable is not set to true).\r\n> - New in version 3.6: The target is being cross-compiled and an emulator is provided (i.e. its [CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.22/prop_tgt/CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR.html#prop_tgt:CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR) target property is set). In this case, the contents of [CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.22/prop_tgt/CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR.html#prop_tgt:CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR) will be prepended to the command before the location of the target executable. \r\n> \r\n> If neither of the above conditions are met, it is assumed that the command name is a program to be found on the PATH at build time.\r\n\r\nThis will allow the locally installed version of nvim to be used instead of the freshly compiled one—and only when cross compiling.",
