    "body": "### Problem\n\nIn truth I still use LuaSnip so this feature may already exist but I had an idea and wanted to put it out there in case it doesn't exist. When expanding a snippet like `class`, it might make an output like this\n\n```python\nclass Foo():\n    def __init__(self, items) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n```\n\nPressing `<Tab>` might jump the user's cursor to the () in `Foo()`, or maybe to the right of `self`, or maybe to somewhere in the `super()` line. Where will the cursor go? There's no way to know other than to press `<Tab>` or whichever mapping you've added for \"jump to next tab stop\" in the snippet to find out.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if the user could know in advance where their cursor will go? I could imagine being able to show that visually would be useful too for debugging.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI could imagine a couple ways to show an indicator\n\n\n#### Extmarks / Inlay Hints\nI could imagine a Lua function that can toggle / display the tab stops for the active snippet. So code like this\n\n```python\nclass Foo():\n    def __init__(self, parent) -> None:\n        super().__init__(parent)\n```\n\nMight become\n\n```python\nclass ${1:Foo}($2):\n    def __init__(self, ${3:parent}) -> None:\n        super().__init__(${3:parent})\n```\n\nNow there's no ambiguity about\n\n- The order of the tabstops\n- Replacing the `parent` text will edit other parts of the same snippet\n- Tab stops with no default text are clearly shown\n\nThen add a highlight group for this (default link it to `hl-Comment`, probably) and the indicators are looking good!\n\n\n#### Highlighting\nBasically the same as the previous idea but without the extmarks. Just expose a highlight group over the original text so people can customize the highlight color. In the above example, the words like `parent` or `()` would be a different color to indicate that it is jumpable. It's an okay idea but has 2 problems\n\n- This method assumes that the tab stop position has default text. e.g. you need something to highlight to be able to highlight it. You could highlight the character before-and-after the tab stop position to get around that but it's a bit clunky\n- Some tab stop points are shared. e.g. writing in text in one position might auto-fill another position. It's pretty common in snippets for that to happen. This isn't that bad but a bit unideal.\n\n\n#### Conclusion\nAnyway just a thought. It seemed like a useful thing to encourage adoption of the built-in LSP snippets. Maybe this already exists?",
