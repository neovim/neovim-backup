(By default, the messages area should behave as the current `target='cmd'` behaves.)\n- Users can customize placement of the msg area by handling an event, something like `:autocmd FileType msg call nvim_win_set_config(0, ...)`.\n",

And as mentioned above, the \"fade away\" behavior can be toggled-on.\n\nBut introducing another message area was never a required part of the \"plan\", unless there is some other outline I've missed. The door is open for doing that later, or for plugins to do it using the enhanced metadata. But the first phase of @luukvbaal's work doesn't need to involve that. I've been extremely consistent since the start, that \"phase 1\" of this work should show messages in the cmdline area, while keeping the door open *in later phases* for other UI choices.",

Moving it to a separate window isn't just a case of customizing the cmdline window. That's why the dedicated message area is a separate window/filetype.\n\nA lot of work has gone into the \"msg\" target (I implemented it first after deciding that completely mimicking the message grid would be unfeasible/unwanted, but the cmdline target has progressed nicely and both seem useful to me now). Dropping it from the module at this point seems unnecessary, it just shouldn't be used by default.\n\n> In the screenshot I showed above, it makes no sense that some messages are in two different places.\n\nThe reason for it is mentioned here:\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/bff7d3fd9f20fe8f8373844454181550dc6ba05d/runtime/lua/vim/_extui/messages.lua#L362-L365\n\nBut obviously that doesn't hold for \"last set\" messages that should be kept with its source. It's questionable anyhow with how the cmdline message target has progressed. Even `nvim -V9` seems usable enough with it now. So yeah it should be fine to remove the above if-statement.\n",

Yes, \"notifications\" are different than messages. The traditional Vim example of \"notifications\" is 'ruler', 'showcmd', and we obviously will expand that (e.g. maybe \"progress\" belongs there).\n\nBut there is still something I don't get: if the \"box\" is for ephemeral messages (\"notifications\"), does that conflict with the idea that some users will want to use it for all messages + notifications? Or if that's not a conflict, then would it make sense  to use the cmdline area as the default for both ?",

Further customization of them may be possible through FileType handlers but I don't see how we could drop the target logic (granted that it won't be used by default).\n\n> Or if that's not a conflict, then would it make sense to use the cmdline area as the default for both ?\n\nDon't think it is a conflict no.

The notifications popup will be useful for some things, but probably not shell output?\n\nIt's not really clear why `verbose`, `:echom`, etc., are treated like notifications. The effect is kind of random. \n\nMy suggestion would be to treat almost everything like non-notifications, except if the caller \"opts in\" by setting a `nvim_echo` flag or something. And furthermore, we could let users configure which message `kind`s they want to always go to the notifications popup. Allowing users to set a `kind` list avoids blocking Nvim 0.12 release while we debate which things go where.\n\nWDYT?",

The notifications popup will be useful for some things, but probably not shell output?\nIt's not really clear why verbose, :echom, etc., are treated like notifications. The effect is kind of random.\n\nThere is no well defined notifications concept yet, so nothing is treated as such per se. Since there is no cmdline area with 'cmdheight' = 0, _all_ regular messages are shown in the dedicated message window. The only exceptions are `list_cmd` and interactively typed `echo/lua_print` kinds, which we assume should be shown indefinitely. Since the dedicated message window has a timeout, they are routed to the pager. That's the only logic behind it currently, no classification of a notification kind.\n\nAnd yes, shell output should probably be routed to the pager as well. Configurable routing sounds useful.",

And furthermore, we could let users configure which message `kind`s they want to always go to the notifications popup. Allowing users to set a `kind` list avoids blocking Nvim 0.12 release while we debate which things go where.\n\nYes, it would be good to allow users to decide which kinds to treat always as \"notifications\". \n\n\n",
