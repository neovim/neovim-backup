    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen passing mixed paths to `grepprg`, `makeprg`, or `shellpipe` on Windows, they put everything after the first `/` into the arguments. However, everything before the first whitespace should be considered part of the program name.\n\n`shellslash` doesn't help.\n\nWindows does not allow forward slashes in file or folder names, so they should be considered path separators. [CreateFile docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea#parameters):\n\n> The name of the file or device to be created or opened. You may use either forward slashes (/) or backslashes (\\) in this name.\n\n[Naming Conventions docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions):\n> The following reserved characters:\n```\n< (less than)\n> (greater than)\n: (colon)\n\" (double quote)\n/ (forward slash)\n\\ (backslash)\n| (vertical bar or pipe)\n? (question mark)\n* (asterisk)\n```\n\n\n\nAlso reproducible on nvim-win64-0.10.4.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\n\n#### Error case\n\n```vim\nset makeprg=C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin/find\nlet &shellpipe = '| %USERPROFILE%\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin\\tee'\ncd %:h\nmake . -name README.md\ncopen\n```\nnvim.exe -Nu ~/minimal.vim -U NONE c:\\code\\public-clones\\neovim\\CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nOutput (_copied from screenshot_):\n```\n:!C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin/find . -name README.md | tee C:\\Users\\idbrii\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\nvim.0\\gmwA7X\\1\n'C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n\nshell returned 255\n```\n(`s/make/grep/g` and you get the same result.)\n\nWindows is fine with this command. Directly running it correctly outputs a list of READMEs:\n```\n:!C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin/find . -name README.md\n```\n\n\nA more practical example is to use your home directory in prg paths (which should work on both Unix and Windows):\n```\nset grepprg=~/.vim/scripts/supergrep\n```\nnvim expands `~` using backslashes so we have mixed slashes:\n```\n'C:\\Users\\idbrii' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n```\n\nHere, `shellslash` *does* have an effect. The resulting path uses only forward slashes but nvim still assumes only backslashes can be part of the name:\n```\n'C:' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n```\n\n`shellpipe` similarly doesn't allow forward slashes.\n```\nset grepprg=C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin/find\nlet &shellpipe = '| %USERPROFILE%/scoop/apps/git/current/usr/bin/tee'\ncd %:h\ngrep . -name README.md\ncopen\n```\n\n#### Argument test\n\nI tested my assumption that prg handling is ending the path at the first `/`:\n\n```vim\nset grepprg=C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin\\echo.exe/test\nlet &shellpipe = '| %USERPROFILE%\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin\\tee'\ncd %:h\ngrep . -name README.md\ncopen\n```\n\nThis command succeeds, but the quickfix output shows that `/test` is considered one of the arguments instead of part of the file path:\n```\n|| /test . -name README.md\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEverything before the first unescaped whitespace should be considered part of the program name.\n\nIf we change `/find` -> `\\find`, then it correctly finds all the README.md files. We shouldn't have to change all our paths to use backslashes. They might come from a variety of places: plugins, environment variables, program output (`where`), etc.\n\nAdditionally, the above minimal vimrc files work correctly on vim, plugins that work on vim will break on nvim. Example: [tpope/vim-eunuch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch)'s `:Cfind` command.\n\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.0.1576\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWin11 (Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26200.7462])\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nCommand Prompt\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nnot set\n\n### Installation\n\nscoop",

Once you add a pipe, it stops working:\n```\nC:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin/find . -name README.md | C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin\\tee junkfile\n\n'C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n```\n_Side note: running this command directly in powershell works.

Probably better to pass it through expand: `let &makeprg = expand(\"C:\\Users\\idbrii\\scoop\\apps\\git\\current\\usr\\bin/find\")`\n\n@chahat-101: Can you confirm that using `let &shellpipe = \">%s 2>&1\"` prevents this error for you too? (Obviously, losing tee isn't ideal. But to make sure I'm not missing something.)",
