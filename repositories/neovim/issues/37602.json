    "body": "### Problem\n\nAs it says at the top of each page, the [Documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/) section of the website is generated from the source, which points to the `master` branch. This means that if one is using the latest stable version from the [Install](https://neovim.io/doc/install/) page (0.11.6 at the time of writing), the documentation will list features that are not available.\n\nI ran into this when trying to turn off lsp semantic highlighting. The [lsp docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#_lua-module:-vim.lsp.semantic_tokens) say that you can use `vim.lsp.semantic_tokens.enable(not vim.lsp.semantic_tokens.is_enabled())` to toggle, but neither `is_enabled` nor `enable` exist on `vim.lsp.semantic_tokens` in 0.11.6.\n\nIt would be helpful if the documentation could be generated per version, with a way to switch to older versions as appropriate. For example, the [jujutsu vcs](https://www.jj-vcs.dev/v0.37.0/) documentation has a dropdown, with `prerelease` (HEAD) as well as all released versions. That way, users can look at the documentation that matches their version.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nN/A\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nN/A\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.6 Build type: Release\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nN/A\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nN/A\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A\n\n### Installation\n\nN/A",
