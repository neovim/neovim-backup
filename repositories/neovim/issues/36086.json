Here's an **unfinished, incorrect** example of some experimenting with it:\n\n<img width=\"177\" height=\"425\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/951ac051-d1cb-44c4-8336-1de6298b01f9\" />\n\nIt would be great to either (1) detect if the character is supported (?) and use them automatically or (2) have an option to provide the character set to `undotree.open()`.\n\ncc @altermo\n\nAs a reference, here is a plugin that uses those characters but for showing Git branches: https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog",
