You should check if everything is OK.\r\n    E308: Warning: Original file may have been changed\r\n\r\n(the behaviour in vim is the same)\r\n\r\nI don't think it is wise to override a file with de-facto no warning. In fact, it cost me at least an hour of work, where the situation was that I run the command in order to see what swap files there are(as I disabled the recovery suggestion upon editing a file). \r\n\r\nI think it is better to either display a confirm message, or to display a single file in the file list in the case there is only a single swap file. A third option would be to save the original file for possible recovery in swap(reasonable?). A forth option is to do the recovery in memory.\r\n\r\nThanks(might be a feature request).\r\n\r\n",
