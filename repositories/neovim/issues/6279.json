The CSI code\r\n    is used instead of <Esc>[.  The advantage is that an <Esc> can quickly be\r\n    recognized in Insert mode, because it can't be confused with the start of a\r\n    special key.\r\n    For the builtin termcap entries, Vim checks if the 'term' option contains\r\n    \"8bit\" anywhere.  It then uses 8-bit characters for the termcap entries, the\r\n    mouse and a few other things.  You would normally set $TERM in your shell to\r\n    \"xterm-8bit\" and Vim picks this up and adjusts to the 8-bit setting\r\n    automatically.\r\n    When Vim receives a response to the t_RV (request version) sequence and it\r\n    starts with CSI, it assumes that the terminal is in 8-bit mode and will\r\n    convert all key sequences to their 8-bit variants.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNvim should detect whether it can use 8-bit mode, via a \"request version\" `TermResponse` (aka \"Primary Device Attributes\"?). Unless there's a better way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\n- Vim in some cases does a synchronous timeout-based check, e.g.: https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/ba6ec182973af726ce9b7b7eb3753fc3a7ae7d1b#diff-366ece1c6e8026aed5df9c6ae82c3967R2622\r\n- [S8C1T mode](http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-C1-_8-Bit_-Control-Characters)",

Specifically we need to tell libtermkey to use 8-bit mode. We need to be able to re-initialize at any time, because (as mentioned above) we don't know when (if ever) the terminal will send a response.\r\n- send `ESC a` to Nvim on stdin and see what happens. Some changes might (or might not) be needed in `src/nvim/keymap.c`.\r\n    - It should always be interpreted as `ESC a`, never `ALT-a`, regardless of `ttimeout` or `ttimeoutlen`.\r\n- send `ALT-a` to Nvim on stdin and see what happens. \r\n    - It should always be interpreted as `ALT-a`, never `ESC a`, regardless of `ttimeout` or `ttimeoutlen`.\r\n\r\n",
