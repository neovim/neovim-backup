The entire purpose of the `\\zs` atom is to allow for arbitrarily narrow qualification of a match using the context in which the match appears, *but which is not actually part of it*. Everything before a `\\zs` is, conceptually, a wholly separate entity, which by its nature is immediately adjacent, but which may be completely unrelated otherwise.\r\n\r\nBack to the “actual behavior” example, the given command should have this result:\r\n```\r\nfirst line\r\nsecond line!!!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible behavior extension:\r\nAllow for a kind of global command that understands the character-wise position of the match.\r\n\r\ne.g. (toy example):\r\n```\r\none banana\r\ntwo apples\r\n```\r\n```vim\r\n:g`\\v^\\k+\\s+\\zs\\a`normal vgU\r\n```\r\n```\r\none Banana\r\ntwo Apples\r\n```",
