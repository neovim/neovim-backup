I think this would be very beneficial for both users and plugin authors to know. The problem that I'm facing is in a situation like this https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim/pull/304 I want to know when a certain fold is opened so I can update the highlights for the new lines that are now in view. I'm currently forced to highlight a certain number of lines (window height) past the top fold in case a fold is opened so the lines are highlighted properly.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIdeally there would be an autoevent FoldOpened and FoldClosed that users and plugin authors could hook into. Plugins like `nvim-ufo` can probably benefit from something like this as well. ",
