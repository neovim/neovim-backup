[With pull diagnostics, those settings have to be on the client-side to function](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/3211).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTo start, I propose adding a new flag `pull_diagnostics_on_save` that sends diagnostic requests after `didSave` instead of `didChange` for that lsp client.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or concerns? I'm happy to try implementing if it sounds like a reasonable idea!",
