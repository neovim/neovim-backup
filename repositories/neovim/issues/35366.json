Anything more \"immediate\" than that is just out of scope for all new events going forward.\n\nWe don't necessarily need to migrate all autocmds to use this approach, but:\n\n- use it as the default approach going forward\n- migrate some existing autocmds where it makes sense to do so\n\n## Implementation\n\nunless you know better, here's a proposed approach:\n\n1. append to a global \"pending queue\" of events\n2. for each event, set its state (`v:event`, `event-data`, window-id, buffer-id, ...)\n3. when we reach the safe-state, unwind all of the pending events\n    - if their handlers trigger deferred events, those new deferred events get queued for the next safe-state \"tick\".",
