As much as I would love that, it seems to me that would either be a headache to plugin writers who'll need to check which style user has and duplicate their regexes, or end up splitting plugins into those usable with vim-regex and those that use PCRE. \n\nMy suggestion is to allow PCRE style regular expressions entirely optionally and distinctly from the existing vim-regex matching, so that mere mortals who do not grok vim-re can more easily write and edit regex matches in vim. It need not interfere with current syntax at all, and perhaps could be just functions like `pcre_match(str, pat)` (equivalent to `str =~ pat` except for using PCRE syntax in pat), and `pcre_substitute(str, pat, sub, flags)` (equivalent to `substitute`, with PCRE syntax in pat). \n\nCurrently, this can sort-of be achieved with external plugins like https://github.com/othree/eregex.vim using its `E2v` function that converts PCRE-regexes into vim-style regexes, but \n(1) it is an external dependency\n(2) there are load order issues - only those plugins that load after eregex.vim can use its functions, and crucially, users can't use it in vimrc itself unless you do something hacky like prefix every statement with `au VimEnter`. \n(3) perhaps most important of all, using `E2v` repeatedly means taking a potentially enormous performance hit, since every regex has to be first parsed character by character by eregex and then transformed into vim-regex textually, after which the actual matching begins. \n\nSo, having a PCRE engine within neovim directly and being able to use it by explicit choice would be a big usability improvement for a lot of us. \n",
