Even if we introduced `vim.lsp.enable(..., {feature={...}})` (WIP branch: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/compare/master...ribru17:neovim:lsp_features ), we *still* need the feature-specific modules and enable implementations (internally), because each lsp \"high-level feature\" (inlay hints, semantic tokens, ...) has its own \"enable\" semantics, thus it would be a lateral move (low-leverage) vs `vim.lsp.<feat>.enable()`.\n\nHowever, some people want to enable these features per-config (i.e per LS). This would not be a \"dynamic toggle\" interface, and it doesn't change the above.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nAdd a field to `vim.lsp.Config` which allows enabling/disabling \"high level features\" for a given config.\n\n\"high level features\" = tokens, hints, diagnostics, formatting, colour, hover, completion, snippets\n\n\n",
