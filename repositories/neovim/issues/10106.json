As long as the ID ranges per plugin are not overlapping, we are okay, but it wouldn't be enough - we do need some sort of grouping that is calculated per buffer before redraw, and lazily, if signs have changed since the last redraw.\r\n\r\nI see two main ways to tackle the grouping issue:\r\n\r\n1) We can also introduce a new option that would allow the user to assign order and grouping using the sign names. For example: `set signcolorder=GitGutter;NoCoverage,NoBranchCoverage`. Groups are separated by `;`, each sign name in a group separated by `,`. Plugin authors can add code to \r\nappend to `signcolorder`.\r\n\r\n2) Alternatively, a global Git registry to allow the various plugin writers to group their plugin signs by ID ranges. For each ID range a fixed position in the sign column can be calculated in redraw, and we would need an option to define the groups. For example, `set signcolranges=4000-10000,0-1000`.\r\n\r\nAt any case, I don't see how we can do this without adding options or extending APIs.",

For example:\r\n\r\n```viml\r\nlet g:gitgutter_sign_added = ' +'\r\n```\r\n",
