Users seeing that item take up significant time will then know (or be directed) to profile the Lua code separately.\r\n\r\nWe should likely also (or first) add a note to `:h :profile` telling end-users that if they're trying to profile a performance issue in their setup, they need to think about the lua side as well.",
