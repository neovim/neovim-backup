    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\n`api.txt` has details on many functions, but there is no place (as far as I know) to see a simplified overview list with function signatures and brief descriptions.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is for adding an overview similar to the former `:help builtin-function-list` in `api.txt` and adding back the overview to `builtin.txt`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe new section in `api.txt` would be similar to the former `Overview` section in `builtin.txt`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Overview\t\t\t\t\t*builtin-function-list*\r\n\r\nUse CTRL-] on the function name to jump to the full explanation.\r\n\r\nUSAGE\t\t\t\tRESULT\tDESCRIPTION\t~\r\n\r\nabs({expr})\t\t\tFloat or Number  absolute value of {expr}\r\nacos({expr})\t\t\tFloat\tarc cosine of {expr}\r\nadd({object}, {item})\t\tList/Blob   append {item} to {object}\r\nand({expr}, {expr})\t\tNumber\tbitwise AND\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the list of items would correspond to the functions documented in `api.txt`.\r\n\r\nThe former overview list would be restored in `builtin.txt`.\r\n\r\n### Update\r\n\r\nWhen initially creating this ticket, I only proposed an overview list for `api.txt`. I hadn't realized that the list had been [removed](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26991#issuecomment-1888109894) from `builtin.txt`. I've updated the text above to reflect that the overview list has been removed from `builtin.txt`, modifying the request to also include adding back the former overview.",
