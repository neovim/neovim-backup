            "body": "Summary of my ideas on how to implement this.\n\nThe functionalities of the semantic token rely on the existence of the `STHighlighter`, which was created automatically when a client that supports it attached the buffer. This is why we enable semantic highlighting by default, and why it can not be disabled globally. I've thought of two ways to refactor `vim.lsp.semantic_token.start()` into `vim.lsp.semantic_token.enable()`:\n\n1. We still create `STHighlighter` on `LspAttach`, but introduce some variables(by `vim.b` and `vim.g`) to mark whether semantic highlighting is enabled; autocmd callbacks will abort on buffers not having the feature enabled by checking these variables.\n\n2. Do not create `STHighlighter` unless the semantic token is enabled on the buffer. This sounds better, but much more complex. Although we can create `STHighlighter` when calling `enable()`, because it was designed to be destroyed once there are no supported clients attached, we cannot create it again unless we have an autocmd to create `STHighlighter` on LSP attach, in doing so, it has reverted to the first approach.\n\nThe design that destroys `STHighlighter` on `LspDetach` has many advantages, such as ensuring that there are no memory leaks, and we don’t need to handle buffer unloads—which trigger `LspDetach`—and buffer reloads—which trigger `LspDetach` followed by `LspAttach`—as separate cases. Therefore, I prefer the first approach. This is just the design I proposed in #34639: keeping `STHighlighter` synchronized with client capabilities, control `enabled` by vim variables.\n",
