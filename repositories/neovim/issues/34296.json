(Maybe also need to think about environment variables and file handles, but that can be a \"revisit later\" topic.)\n\nIf the server is \"remote\" and not restartable, we should show an error and cancel the `:restart`.\n\n> If one client restarts the server, shouldn't the other clients have to know that they need to reattach?\n\nThe current spec for this feature is that all other clients will just detach, not reattach. Reattaching all the clients is a \"nice to have\" that in practice may not be a common use-case. \n\n",
