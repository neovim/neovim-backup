    "body": "### Problem\n\nMost of the `:lsp` subcommands are thin wrappers around functions from `vim.lsp`:\n- `:lsp enable`: `vim.lsp.enable(..., true)`\n- `:lsp disable`: `vim.lsp.enable(..., false)`\n- `:lsp stop`: `Client:stop()`\n\n`:lsp restart` has no non-interactive equivalent, so plugins/configs which wish to programmatically restart a client either have to do it manually or use `vim.cmd.lsp { 'restart', ... }`\n\n### Solution\n\nIntroduce `Client:restart()`. I would be willing to write this myself, but I want to make sure this is a wanted change, as it seems slightly niche.",

            "body": "The API I'm imagining is `Client:restart(force, callback)`. `force` would simply get forwarded to `Client:stop()`, and `callback` would be called with the new client as an argument once the restart was successful. The implementation would be similar to [how it currently exists in `:lsp restart`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/1aa26f5d55550dd12c2cfd0f74618f0dcd6467ec/runtime/lua/vim/_core/ex_cmd/lsp.lua#L134-L153).\n\nExamples:\n\n```lua\n-- Basic use (restart all clients)\nfor _, client in ipairs(vim.lsp.get_clients()) do\n  client:restart()\nend\n\n-- Restart a bad client which freezes randomly\nlocal timer = vim.uv.new_timer()\ntimer:start(0, 1000, function()\n  local bad_client = ...\n  if client_is_frozen(bad_client) then\n    -- Force restart the client\n    bad_client:restart(true)\n  end\nend)\n\n-- Restart a client and do something new with it once it restarts\n-- (in this example, set 'busy' while restarting)\nlocal old_client = ...\nfor _, buffer in ipairs(old_client.attached_buffers) do\n  vim.bo[buffer].busy = 1\nend\nold_client:restart(nil, function(new_client)\n  for _, buffer in ipairs(new_client.attached_buffers) do\n    vim.bo[buffer].busy = 0\n  end\nend)\n```\n\n---\n\nAs for whether this method should exist in neovim core, it seems to come down to how niche it would be. I myself don't have a use for this method, and I'm simply offering to write the implementation because I wrote it for `:lsp restart`. There's been some support for it (two 👍 reactions) which suggests it may be a useful addition. @MariaSolOs I'd love to get your thoughts on whether this should be added, since you have experience with `vim.lsp`.",
