    "body": "### Problem\n\nThings are working nicely when you have a `requirements.txt` file. It gets picked up as \"requirements\" and everything you expect works (Treesitter syntax highlighting, file picker previews, etc.).\n\nBut if you have a `requirements-lock.txt`, `requirements-freeze.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt` or any other variant that file does not get seen as \"requirements\". Instead it gets picked up as \"text\". Using these variants are quite common in the Python world. The `-` is optional too, it's based on user preference.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll `requirements*.txt` variants get picked up as \"requirements\".\n\nI see the reference to it here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/debabaf884fc26e9dc257aa5b62581d3846f80f1/runtime/lua/vim/filetype.lua#L1789\n\nI don't see other examples of `*` being used but are wildcards possible here? In my opinion this wouldn't be worth exploring if not because there's too many project specific variants.\n\nA workaround for now is to use `vim.filetype.add({ pattern = { [\"requirements.*.txt\"] = \"requirements\" } })` which does provide the expected behavior at the cost of lugging around custom configuration. I don't know much about Lua but while it works, it feels incorrect because the `.` isn't escaped but if I use `%.*` it never matched. Also using `.txt$` would be more strict but this also never matched.\n\nAlso giving credit to @clason in https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/7724#issuecomment-2711640884 for helping shape the workaround.",
