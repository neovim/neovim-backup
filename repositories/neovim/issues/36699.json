    "body": "### Problem\n\nAs the title says. Here is also the [start](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start) documentation. Also I believe https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/36635 to be related or this may help get that resolved.\n\nEssentially, executing\n\n```\n:call system('cmd.exe /c start \"\" \"C:\\\\Program Files\"')\n```\nworks but the other options\n\n```\n:lua =vim.system({'cmd.exe', '/c', 'start', '\"\"', '\"C\\\\:Program Files\"'})\n:lua vim.fn.system('cmd.exe /c start \"\" \"C:\\\\Program Files\"')\n```\ndo not work.\n\nAlso `vim.system()` does work without the quotes parameter,\n\n```\nlua =vim.system({'cmd.exe', '/c', 'start', 'C:\\\\'})\n\n```\n\nSome extra info: `start` always uses the first argument as the title of the Command Prompt window it tries to open. Therefore these commands in the Command Prompt,\n\n```\ncmd.exe /c start C:\\\ncmd.exe /c start \"C:\\Program Files\"\n```\nwould not have same effect since in the second one, `start` would open a Command Prompt window with that title. For that command to be valid you would have to do,\n\n```\ncmd.exe /c start \"\" \"C:\\Program Files\"\n```\nThis also means that to use `start` universally for opening files, directories, URLs, etc. you need to use it as above. \n\nLooking at my issue at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/36635 it appears that `start` is a viable option for it to be resolved, but this issue needs to be solved before that to ensure that `start` can accept all inputs. I am also not sure how the `vim.cmd()` call would look like if you want to use that method, because you need to place three things in quotes and escaping doesn't seem to work...\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open Neovim\n2.  Execute `:lua =vim.system({'cmd.exe', '/c', 'start', '\"\"', '\"C\\\\:Program Files\"'})`\n3. Execute `:lua vim.fn.system('cmd.exe /c start \"\" \"C:\\\\Program Files\"')`\n4. Execute `:call system('cmd.exe /c start \"\" \"C:\\\\Program Files\"')`\n5. Last one will work, others won't\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFor the corresponding file or folder to open\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A\n\n### Installation\n\nwinget",
