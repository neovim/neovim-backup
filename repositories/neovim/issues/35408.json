If I place the cursor on Response and call `vim.lsp.buf.type_definition` I get `No Locations Found`\n\nIf I create a typo on the above code like this:\n```ts\nfunction foo() {\n  let r:Respon = new Response\n}\n```\nAnd then fix the typo again to the original code, suddenly `vim.lsp.buf.type_definition` works as expected.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShouldn't need a typo to \"wake up\" the LSP, goto definition etc. should work upon loading the file.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n11.3 release\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nn/a\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch / Ubuntu Server 24.04\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage (Ubuntu), repo (Arch)",

That said I can't be completely sure this is an nvim bug, an issue connected with denols, or quirks in nvim's lsp bridge. I'm posting this in part to find others using neovim / deno and happy to further investigate towards a fix. Beyond `vim.lsp.set_log_level(\"debug\")` any pointers for debugging LSP communication behind the scenes?\n\nThere's other friction working with deno's LSP, for example loading deno uri virtual documents with go to definition et al (see [this issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30719)) but [this lua snippet](https://github.com/onion108/onion27-nvim-config/blob/main/lua/terminal/tweaks/deno-lsp-correction.lua) fixes that.\n\nPresently it seems to be a 50-50 whether inbuilt types can be navigated with goto definition, type declaration etc.. Hoping with a few pointers this might be a fairly easy fix.\n",
