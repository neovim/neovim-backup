    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\n`vim.diagnostic.open_float` works one column beyond the end of the diagnostic. I think it's because this [`d.end_col >= col`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/lua/vim/diagnostic.lua#L1316) should be `d.end_col > col` since `end_col` is exclusive. But reasoning about off-by-one errors is hard so someone more familiar with the code should think about whether that fix will present other issues before applying it.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCall `vim.diagnostic.open_float` one column past the diagnostic and observe that the window opens.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`vim.diagnostic.open_float` should only work if called inside the diagnostic.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.7.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nCentOS 7.9\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nxfce4-terminal 0.8.10 (Xfce 4.16)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nsystem package manager",
