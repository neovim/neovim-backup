    "body": "### Problem\n\nIt seems that neovim may have an issue merging `v:oldfiles` data when `:rshada` is used.  `:rshada` does not appear to repopulate `v:oldfiles`\nI've confirmed this on both Linux builds and Windows builds of neovim 0.11.2\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9523 is somewhat related, but the workarounds do not seem to work anymore (since `:rshada!` now seems to be required - which will destroy session data)\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open a neovim instance with an empty configuration: `nvim -u NONE`\n2. Open a second neovim instance and write a test file: `nvim -u NONE test1.txt`.  Write the test file (`:wq`)\n3. Return to the first neovim instance and run `:rshada`.  This should merge the shada data with the existing session.\n4. Run the `:oldfiles` command.  The `test1.txt` file should be included in the list at this point, but it isnt.\n5. Run `:rshada!`.  This should replace the current session data with the data from shada.\n6. Run the `:oldfiles1 command again.  The `test1.txt` file should now be in the list, but it should have been in the list in step 4.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect `:rshada` to re-read the shada data and merge it into `v:oldfiles` so that files opened since the neovim process was created are shown\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim doesn't have rshada (`E492: Not an editor command: rshada`)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux and Windows 11 (64bit)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.15.1 but issue is also present with neovim-qt\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nWindows: installed from zip   Linux:  installed from Arch linux repo via pacman",
