If you keep a reference to a magic dict around, but the variable is overrided to a non dict, then setting that previous reference does... what?\r\n- Dictionaries can contain vim function references, which we currently don't support. I'm actually not sure if g:variables can store functions right now without thinking of the dict case...\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are:\r\n- fully support vim/lua interop\r\n- support just for dictionaries and ignore incompatibility problems as user error\r\n- raise an error when trying to operate on these returned dicts via metamethods.\r\n\r\nIs there any other special type than dictionary and vim functions, btw?",

For e.g., a table `lb` with same lifecycle as vim buffer.\r\n\r\n@ipod825 you're right that lifetimes (`b:`, `w:`, `t:`) are an important use-case. Lua _closures_ (`vim.b=function()…`) work nicely in the Vimscript-Lua bridge but you are asking specifically about metatable support. \r\n\r\nCurrently, bridging a Lua table erases the metatable:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal f = function()\r\n  local M = { 'mt1', 'mt2' }\r\n  local l = { a=1 }\r\n  local call = function(_, f)\r\n    if l[f] then\r\n      l[f] = l[f] + 1\r\n    else\r\n      l[f] = 1\r\n    end\r\n    print(vim.inspect(l))\r\n  end\r\n  setmetatable(M, {\r\n     __call = call,\r\n     __index = call,\r\n  })\r\n  vim.b.foo = M\r\n  GlobalM = M\r\n  -- vim.api.nvim_buf_set_var(0, 'foo', M)\r\n\r\n  print(vim.b.foo)  -- table: 0x0102605460\r\n  print(GlobalM)    -- table: 0x01026163e0\r\n  print(M)          -- table: 0x01026163e0\r\nend\r\nf()\r\n\r\n-- Test cases:\r\n--    :lua print(GlobalM['b'])\r\n--        => works\r\n--    :lua print(GlobalM('test'))\r\n--        => works\r\n--    :echo b:foo\r\n--        => [ 'mt1', 'mt2' ]\r\n--    :call b:foo()\r\n--        => E884\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nWhat if the bridge worked like this for container types:\r\n\r\n1. ~~In Vimscript, it just returns an opaque id/handle~~\r\n    - ~~nothing \"bridged\" except the variable name~~\r\n1. In Vimscript, bridged Lua container types are _readonly_. In Lua, bridged Vimscript container types are _readonly_.\r\n    - We should have done this from the beginning. It's essentially the same as current behavior, but less confusing.\r\n1. In Lua, the ref continues to live entirely in Lua-land in Lua-managed `b:/w:/t:` tables.\r\n    - When a buffer/window/tab closes, Nvim removes the Lua ref from the Lua `b:/w:/t:` table.  Lua will garbage-collect it unless some other Lua stuff is still using it.\r\n    - Not supported for ~~g:~~ `l:` since there is no use-case?\r\n1. Rules to document:\r\n    - Lua tables are readonly from Vimscript.\r\n    - Vimscript containers are readonly from Lua.\r\n    - Lua _metatable behavior_ only works from Lua (not `v:lua`, nor `g:/l:/b:/w:/t:`).",

We would like to have a hierarchy of settings instead of the flat ones currently in use. Initially for more advanced font configuration, and better structure of settings. But there will probably be more use cases in the future. \r\n\r\nIt would  also allow us to get rid of the dictwatcher, at the cost of no longer being configurable from the vimscript side. We also publish a few variables that should be read-only by the user, and again a metatable would allow us to enforce that.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is a `setup` style configuration, like most plugins. But since everything can be configured at runtime, I think it's a poor fit. `vim.g.neovide.*`, would be much nicer. Of course something like `require(\"neovide\").config.value=1` is also possible, but that's not a very standard way of doing things.\r\n\r\nI have also seen various proposals for configuring plugins using `vim.g.pluginname.*`, and I think supporting, metatables, or even just updatable dictionaries is a requirement for that.\r\n",
