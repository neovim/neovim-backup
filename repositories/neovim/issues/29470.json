    "body": "### Problem\n\nHi!\r\n\r\nI recently had to re-install my OS (which I didn't update in some time prior to that), and after fresh installation (and installation of the latest version of all the tools I'm using) I noticed some strange color scheme changes in neovim.. The color scheme haven't change, only the way some color groups are colored.. I was searching for it online, and found the github issue [#26378](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26378#issuecomment-1838256803) that touches on that, and in my particular case the problem was with the colors that were previously specified by `Identifier` color group (which are now rendered as a `Normal` color) and I think the mentioned github issue addresses that change:\r\n\r\n`@variable and @lsp.type.variable are cleared instead of linking to Identifier to reduce visual noise.`\r\n\r\nI tried setting `@variable` to the same color the `Identifier` is set to, but nothing has changed.. Also, changing the `Normal` color to `Identifier`'s color does work, but I don't want the rest of the text that used to be `Normal` to have the same color as Identifier, if that makes sense.. Now, obviously some text is still colored as `Identifier`, but the problem is with the part that used to be but it's not anymore..\r\n\r\nHere are screenshots of before and after for easier visualization:\r\n\r\nBEFORE:\r\n![before](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/6886981/5a886a16-f3f8-4905-a9d1-2ae57987aa66)\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n![after](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/6886981/7d742220-4d1e-461d-ac5b-87dc525a078b)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am referring to couple of lines at the top (18 to 15 to be precise) which used to be purple (`Identifier`), and now they are mostly white (`Normal`).. Also, I have black margin background in fzf, which used to have the same color as fzf background (no difference, all the same color):\r\n\r\n![margin](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/6886981/3f967614-8a2a-4234-b48d-1f8e0590a8fa)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, nothing in the config files/colorsheme changed, my home partition was not even mounted and stayed intact..\r\nI understand some color groups are being un-linked, so I'm wondering if there is the way to link it back (at least the ones I'm having a problem with - `Identifier` and fzf margin background)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI can post my colorscheme/fzf config file if that helps, though again they didn't change..\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nProvided image above..\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nIn vim my colorshceme is completely broken..\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.13.2 (bb8ea18e)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nsystem pacakge manager (pacman)",
