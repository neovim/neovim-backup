This boilerplate has coalesced into `vim.lsp.util.open_floating_preview`, but such functionality should be both (1) pruned down and curated into a more thoughtful and coherent interface, and (2) moved out of `vim.lsp.util` and into `vim.ui`.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nCreate `vim.ui.open_win` that handles the use case of creating windows of all kinds in an ergonomic way.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* `vim.ui.open_win` should be able to open floating windows as well as splits (horizontal and vertical) and tabs.\r\n* `vim.ui.open_win` should substantially reduce boilerplate for creating and opening floating windows.\r\n\r\n## Proposed interface\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n--- @param contents string[]|int An array of strings containing the lines\r\n---                              of text to display in the window OR an\r\n---                              integer representing a buffer number to\r\n---                              display in the window\r\n--- @param opts table Options table (see details below)\r\n--- @return number |winid| of new window\r\nvim.ui.open_win(contents, {\r\n  -- Opts table is a \"sum type\" / \"union\", the type of window it\r\n  -- creates is based on the top-level key provided. It as an error\r\n  -- to provide more than one top-level key\r\n  float = {\r\n    -- Create a floating window. All keys from |nvim_open_win()| are valid in this table.\r\n    -- Omitted keys use default values from |vim.ui.config()|.\r\n    height = 100,\r\n    width = 50,\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  split = {\r\n    -- Create a split\r\n    vertical = true | false, -- defaults to false\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  tab = {\r\n    -- Create a new tab\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, create `vim.ui.config()` that sets default values for some options. This should work similarly to `vim.diagnostic.config()`. Plugin authors can use `vim.ui.open_win()` and omit values to use the defaults supplied by the user in `vim.ui.config()`:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.ui.config({\r\n  float = {\r\n    border = \"rounded\",\r\n  },\r\n  split = {\r\n    -- Prefer vertical splits by default\r\n    vertical = true,\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n`vim.ui.config()` is not limited to configuring options for `vim.ui.open_win()`, but covers any user-definable default/preference for anything under `vim.ui`.",

There's nothing \"wrong\" with vim.cmd.split, just as there's nothing \"wrong\" with vim.api.nvim_open_win.\r\n\r\nFair point, but also slightly derailing from the given problem statement. But I guess it makes sense to look at the whole picture.\r\n\r\nLooks like there are two separate points:\r\n\r\n- See what additional options `nvim_open_win` could support to get rid of the floating window positioning logic in `open_floating_preview` and `make_floating_popup_options`. This is kinda independent from the proposed `open_win` but would compose (due to the `float = {}` opts)\r\n\r\n- The ergonomics for general window creation. I think the uniqueness handling that `open_floating_preview` currently takes care of could also go into this. E.g. `open_win` could create an object where you can call `:toggle()`, `:open()`, `:close()` on. It would move some of the logic for the uniqueness handling to the consumers, but I think this separation of concerns makes sense, after all the consumer needs to decide _which_ window should have what kind of uniqueness semantics.\r\n\r\n\r\n> retrieve the window ID (you get this is as the return value of nvim_open_win, but requires a separate API call with a split)\r\n> set the window's buffer to the scratch buffer\r\n\r\nJust to complete the picture: `nvim_open_win` takes the buffer as argument. For floating window it is currently just step 1 (create buffer) and step 2 (call `nvim_open_win(buf, ...)`)\r\n\r\nMost of the logic around opening floating windows seems to be around calculating the position, and configuring the buffer.\r\n",

I do think it could get tricky with edge cases though, as we'd probably have to handle windows being toggled once (closed) but never reopened to avoid leaking memory when saving window states. There's also the case where there's a split window that is closed by toggle, then its previous parent frame is removed by closing its \"sibling\" windows. Working out where to re-insert the window into the layout would be tough. Sorry if that's outside the scope of this issue, just my initial thoughts on the idea :)\r\n\r\n",
