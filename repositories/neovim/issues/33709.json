But, if you look closely at the statusline information about the file in Neovim, you'll see something weird. Although, the name of the file might be `Desktop Entry Specification(s) in GNOME.md`, it will show `Desktop Entry Specification(s) in GNOME.md'`. **NOTICE** : there's an extra character `'` in the name of the file. Means, I'm choosing `Desktop Entry Specification(s) in GNOME.md` file using the file picker but Neovim is opening `Desktop Entry Specification(s) in GNOME.md'` which makes a completely different file and hence displays nothing.\n\nI've made video recording this (notice the statusline name of the file).\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b9d7aaf-0dd6-4137-b520-f5ac47560ccc\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Make sure Neovim is installed and configured\n2. Prepare a file, as an example `*.md`, for testing\n3. Right-click on the `*.md` file and click `Open With...`\n4. Choose `Neovim` in the file picker options and check `Open`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim to open the file properly.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nDon't know, since `Vim` doesn't appear in the file picker\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nFedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGnome Terminal 48.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nDNF",
