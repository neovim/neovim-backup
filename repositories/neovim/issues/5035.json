These need three variations: one that just fails if the session already has an attached text UI, one that detaches any attached text UI first (like `screen -D -R`), and one that attaches without detaching any other attached text UI (like `screen -x`).  (That last one is optional, but I'd find it quite useful.)\n\ncc @jameysharp\n",

In a few works the TUI delivered by core spawns and connects to one Neovim instance. What you miss here is the ability to manage different servers, which is not implemented in TUI.\r\nVeonim implemented the server management. Unfortunately the original repository went away, here is a deep link to the functionality you want from my personal fork: https://github.com/hoschi/veonim/blob/master/docs/readme.md#multiple-concurrent-neovim-instances\r\nI guessed, but not researched, that the fork I posted has the same functionality and you can find it by reading the docs.\r\n\r\nIn general, I just suggested searching for a client which implements the management of multiple Neovim instances ... which runs on Windows. A starting point would be the wiki which lists different clients.",
