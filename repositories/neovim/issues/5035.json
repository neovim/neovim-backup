These need three variations: one that just fails if the session already has an attached text UI, one that detaches any attached text UI first (like `screen -D -R`), and one that attaches without detaching any other attached text UI (like `screen -x`).  (That last one is optional, but I'd find it quite useful.)\n\ncc @jameysharp\n",

In a few works the TUI delivered by core spawns and connects to one Neovim instance. What you miss here is the ability to manage different servers, which is not implemented in TUI.\r\nVeonim implemented the server management. Unfortunately the original repository went away, here is a deep link to the functionality you want from my personal fork: https://github.com/hoschi/veonim/blob/master/docs/readme.md#multiple-concurrent-neovim-instances\r\nI guessed, but not researched, that the fork I posted has the same functionality and you can find it by reading the docs.\r\n\r\nIn general, I just suggested searching for a client which implements the management of multiple Neovim instances ... which runs on Windows.

All buffers (even the `:term` buffers) are still running but you are back to the shell there you originally typed `nvim` to start neovim. Similar to `:suspend` but in such a way that the PID of nvim is not suspended but keeps running in the background ad hence can not be resurrected with `fg` from the shell but with some other command (like `nvim --reattach` or so). You could then even close your xterm window open another xterm widow and reattach to the still running neovim instance where all you buffers are still there.  That is what they mean by \"like tmux\".",

            "body": "Thanks for the clarification, @lucc . It still seems useless to me, but perhaps you could sketch some usage examples? It seems to me that the only thing you can do with that setup but cannot do with `:terminal` is to have a long-running command executing in vim itself, not in a terminal. But I've never run a vimscript command that took more than 2 seconds to complete - probably because I tend to use a terminal to do compilation, rather than e.g. `system('some build system')` from inside vimscript.\r\n\r\nThere's a huge advantage to using vim containing `:terminal` buffers instead of tmux, because you can use all the normal vim-like commands over the terminal buffers, such as scrolling around, copying into multiple registers, closing and reopening of course, and moving the terminal between tabs / resizing it etc. - all of that becomes available to script inside the vimrc or using plugins. Another advantage is that all your action happens in one vim instance, so they all share buffers and copying and pasting and autocompletion over current buffer contents becomes a lot easier.\r\n\r\nI actually do use tmux, a little bit, because it has a shared instance functionality ([wemux](https://github.com/zolrath/wemux)) which makes it possible for a coworker to ssh into my machine and share screens / type together, much like VSCode's [LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare). If NeoVim could offer that functionality simply using a plugin it could be great.",

I would like to be able to open the same buffer on both monitors in different terminals without forcing one to be read only or having to refresh it.\r\n- I use the rust-analyzer LSP, and it takes a lot of CPU and memory to run. If I open the same file in more than one terminal (eg from ssh), I get another copy of the LSP that can't benefit from an already running, already warm insurance. It both takes time to start and doubles memory usage. I would like to be able to reuse the LSP when I open the same file in another nvim instance.\r\n- I have a lot of virtual desktops and sometimes I just want to edit a file quickly without hunting the desktop where I first open the file.",
