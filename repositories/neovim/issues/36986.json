From what I can see, this change would be mostly self-contained within the existing treesitter health check and will reuse the current runtimepath patterns, so it seems like a reasonable place for me to start contributing.\n\nI have looked into `runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/health.lua` and saw how the existing health checks are implemented using `vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file('parser/*', true)`, taking runtimepath order\n\nI think a similar approach could work for Tree-sitter queries by using `vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file('queries/**/*.scm', true)` to get the query files across runtimepath\n\nMy current idea is to:\n- Parse query file paths to extract the language and query type (for example, `queries/lua/highlights.scm`)\n- Add a new **\"Tree-sitter queries\"** section to `:checkhealth vim.treesitter`\n- Report which query types are available per languages in the `queries/` folder without treating missing queries as errors\n\nI am sure this is purely diagnostic, similar to parsers section, and to help users understand where queries are coming from when debugging Tree-sitter behavior. \n\nQuick questions: \n- Does this seem like a useful addition?\n- Should the output formatting of queries section be similar to parsers section like `name query_name(folds, highlight, etc) path`\n- Are there any type of edge case I should know and should be careful about?\n\nHappy to adjust the approach based on feedback. Thanks!\n\n",
