Extmarks don't fully work since they are attached to a buffer line, which makes handling folds much more complicated and also makes it impossible to draw the scrollbar past the end of the buffer (nevertheless, I've made an [attempt](https://codeberg.org/gpanders/dotfiles/commit/2adbad927e1ff117d13670005782e64c0931224a)).\n\nbfredl mentioned that Vim supports this now, so we can look at importing those patches. Or maybe we can do our own from-scratch implementation.",
