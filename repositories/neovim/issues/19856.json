    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\n\nNo\n\n### Feature description\n\nCurrently, previewing a command requires creating a command and specifying a preview callback function. This has several limitations:\r\n\r\n- the input passed to the callback can only be supplied from the command line, not programmatically (an example of this is typing in a [`dressing.nvim`](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) input box and wanting to feed the input to the command preview callback)\r\n- it is not possible to assign a keybinding to show the preview (e.g. toggle it on and off) because one must be in command-line mode and actively type the command and its arguments \r\n- typing in command-line mode can have unwanted side effects, e.g. calling `getchar` inside the callback moves the cursor (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19035) \r\n\r\nI think the idea of saving buffer state and restoring it later is more universally useful than just for command-line mode. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nPreferably, two new functions would be introduced: let's call them `save` and `restore`\r\n\r\nPlugin authors can then call `save`,  modify the buffer state and later call `restore` to restore any highlights / changed text.",

But maybe \"saving buffer state and restoring it later\" doesn't fit under that umbrella. What do others think?",
