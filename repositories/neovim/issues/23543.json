Instead, it \"ghostly\" moves upward, but not visually. If I press CTRL-P twice, it moves 2 lines up. If I press CTRL-P then h, it moves diagonally up left. Therefore, it is waiting for another input to update the cursor visual.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have tested this inside WSL Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS\r\n- from Windows Terminal\r\n- from CMD\r\n- using appimage from release version 0.9.0\r\n- using apt-get release 0.6.1\r\n\r\nI have tested this on Windows\r\n- from nvim-qt\r\n- from nvim CMD\r\n- using win64 msi from release version 0.9.0\r\n\r\nAll of this on plain unmodified neovim.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should moves the cursor upwards immediately.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am not a plugin user, so I usually use plain vim and/or neovim with init.vim symbolically linked to .vimrc for trivial configurations.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently I have opened myself to experiment with lsp zero. There I notices the action of selecting the previous option for autocomplete, CTRL-P, do not work properly (as described). I then noticed as I experiment with other plugins, such as telescope, the same problem pertain existing.\r\n\r\nI have never used the keybind CTRL-P in plain vim or neovim before, and become curious what its function originally is, and it is as described from :help, similar to arrow up, or k.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried the keybind, apparently the problem is not plugin based, but is inherent to neovim itself. The correct behavior pertains in vim. It is only broken in neovim.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.6.0 and 0.9.0\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno, vim 8.2\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nWindows 11 + WSL and Windows 11\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nWindows Terminal and CMD\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nappimage and apt-get",

You guys can update the `~/.docker/config.json` and add the following to remap the detach key to something else.\n\n```\n{\n    \"detachKeys\": \"ctrl-e,e\"\n}\n```",
