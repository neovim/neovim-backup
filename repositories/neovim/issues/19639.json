Can be invoked from insert mode\r\n2. Records macro without overwriting the key (even if recording is cancelled)\r\n3. Warns about overwriting existing keys\r\n4. Any shortcut can be used, including combinations with control keys, so no need in separate play shortcut (which for `q` is `@` by the way).\r\n5. Allows to edit macros before saving\r\n6. Allows to persist macros between sessions\r\n7. \"dot\" for recording is easier to memorize that \"q\" for ??? (not quitting apparently), which gives a potential possibility to rebind `q` to quit in 2048",
