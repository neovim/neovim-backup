I'm curious whether adding our own fields is discouraged or not.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nBefore/After for `rustaceanvim`:\n\n```lua\n-- Before\nvim.g.rustaceanvim = vim.tbl_deep_extend(\n  'force', \n  vim.g.rustaceanvim or {}, \n  { server = { default_settings = { ... } } }\n)\n\n-- After\nvim.lsp.config('rust-analyzer', { default_settings = { ... } }\n-- or in lsp/rust-analyzer.lua\nreturn { default_settings = { ... } }\n```\n\nBefore/After for `blink.cmp` (using WIP V2 APIs)\n\n```lua\n-- Before\nlocal cmp = require('blink.cmp')\ncmp.lsp.config('rust-analyzer', { max_items = 10 })\n\n-- After\nvim.lsp.config('rust-analyzer', { blink_cmp = { max_items = 10 } })\n-- or in lsp/rust-analyzer.lua\nreturn { blink_cmp = { max_items = 10 } }\n```\n\nIn both cases, it's still possible to include the LSP specific configuration in `lsp/*.lua` by including the \"Before\" option before the `return`. However, for plugins, you would need to check that blink.cmp exists before configuring. For example:\n\n```lua\nif pcall(require, 'blink.cmp') then\n  local cmp = require('blink.cmp')\n  cmp.lsp.config('rust-analyzer', { max_items = 10 })\nend\n\nreturn {\n -- regular lsp config\n}\n```",

It is redundant as it is the same as `settings`. Not sure why one would set `default_settings` via `vim.lsp.config` if you can set `settings` directly instead.\n\nMaybe @mrcjkb could clarify.\n\n\n> From a plugin author POV, you don't need to re-invent the lsp.config API if you need to support more than one LSP. With keys like blink_cmp, I feel like it's clear that the option belongs specifically to that plugin.\n\nIsn't `blink_cmp` also supporting non-LSP features. So you have part of the config done via vim.lsp.config, and part via some custom blink.cmp mechanism? Wouldn't that be more confusing for users?\n\n---\n\n\n> An advantage of setting stuff directly on the Client object is that, similar to buffers/windows/tabpages, it is very useful to have the state get garbage-collected when the object goes out of scope.\n\n`vim.lsp.config` isn't bound to the `Client` instance lifecycle.\n\nI could see the appeal for runtime state. And I could also see additional value if it were about a plugin using `LspAttach`/`client.config` - to account for users setting instance specific configuration values by using `vim.lsp.start` (client scoped config instead of server scoped).\n\nBut so far none if this was mentioned. My distaste for mixing plugin/core settings into the same bag probably comes a bit from DAP and how vscode extensions freely intermix client and server settings, making it very confusing for users moving to other clients which then don't support the vscode-extension specific settings.\n\nIf we support something like this, I think we should at least have a dedicated `plugins` property to be explicit.\n",

            "body": "A bit of history from my side:\n\nrustaceanvim's configuration was designed before `vim.lsp.config` was a thing.\nIt uses a `vim.g.rustaceanvim` config table, which has 3 fields[^1]:\n\n- `tools`: Plugin configuration.\n- `dap`: Configuration of the nvim-dap integration.\n- `server`: LSP client configuration template.\n\n[^1]: The field names come from rust-tools.nvim, of which rustaceanvim was a fork.\n\nThe type of `server` is not `@type vim.lsp.ClientConfig`, but `@type rustaceanvim.lsp.ClientOpts`, which rustaceanvim uses as _a template_ to generate a `@type vim.lsp.ClientConfig`.\n\nAt some point, quite a few users started asking for the ability to set LSP client options for rustaceanvim's LSP client using `vim.lsp.config`.\nBecause it enables picking up configs that were set for multiple clients (e.g. with a `\"*\"` key), I decided that it would be useful and added it.\n\n**But rustaceanvim only merges it with the `server` (`rustaceanvim.lsp.ClientOpts`) field, not the general plugin configuration**\n\n> Especially with the default_settings. It is redundant as it is the same as settings. Not sure why one would set default_settings via vim.lsp.config if you can set settings directly instead.\n>\n> Maybe @mrcjkb could clarify.\n\nThis is slightly off-topic, but here's the clarification:\n\nIn `rustaceanvim.lsp.ClientOpts`, `settings` is of type `table | fun(project_root:string|nil, default_settings: table):table`.\nThe default implementation (`@type fun(project_root:string|nil, default_settings: table):table`) uses heuristics to set certain defaults based on the runtime environment (e.g. enabling Clippy diagnostics if Clippy is available).\n`default_settings` exists so that you can statically configure default LSP client options using a table, without losing the dynamic configuration at runtime. If you don't want the dynamic runtime configuration, you can configure `settings` as a `table` instead of using `default_settings`.\n\nIn short, `vim.lsp.ClientConfig` fields are _compatible_ with `rustaceanvim.lsp.ClientOpts` but _the reverse is not true_.\nSo yes, the fact that it is possible to set arbitrary fields that are specific to rustaceanvim's implementation is an accident.\n",
