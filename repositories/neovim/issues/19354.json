Meaning if you last ran `:s/foo/bar/g` to replace all instances of `foo` in a line with `bar`, then move your cursor to a different line and press `&`, it will still only replace the first instance of `foo` with `bar`. The `:&&` ex command *does* re-use the flags, but is relatively more cumbersome (four key presses rather than one). The latter is much more useful and a more common operation. To regain the original behavior, users can still use the `:&` ex command.\r\n  - **Status**: Done #19365 \r\n- 🚫 ~~Swap `p` and `P` in visual mode (`xnoremap p P | xnoremap P p`)~~\r\n  - **Rationale**: The fact that \"pasting\" in visual mode clobbers the yanked contents is a common footgun in Vim. The `P` key was added to avoid this: it preserves the contents of the unnamed register so that you can use `P` repeatedly to \"paste\" the same contents. This behavior is more intuitive and commonplace in other editing environments, so let's make it the default for `p`. If a user wants the original behavior, they can use `P` (or unmap the defaults).\r\n  - **Status**: There are a number of good arguments against this; see [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19354#issuecomment-1184425231) and [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19354#issuecomment-1188301778).\r\n- [ ] Map `gs` to `:sort`\r\n  - **Rationale**: The default `gs` mapping is so utterly useless it almost seems like a joke. Instead, make `gs` an operator in normal mode that sorts the given range (in visual mode, make it sort the selection). I currently use this:\r\n  ```vim\r\n  function! Sort(...) abort\r\n    '[,']sort\r\n    call setpos('.', getpos(\"''\"))\r\n  endfunction\r\n  nnoremap gs m'<Cmd>set operatorfunc=Sort<CR>g@\r\n  xnoremap gs :sort<CR>\r\n  ```\r\n  - **Status**: Make `gs` some kind of \"substitute\" operator for consistency with the default `s` mapping. Example: `xnoremap gs mr:s/\\%V` (and an equivalent operator in normal mode)\r\n- [ ] 'title' and 'titlestring' ? https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1248\r\n- [x] `shortmess+=C` #23907\r\n- [ ] `smoothscroll` #23939\r\n- [x] `termguicolors` #26407 ",

In ~10 years of using Vim as my primary editor, I don't think I have ever intentionally used the fact that `p` replaces the unnamed register. It's always been something I've lived with or worked around. Granted I'm a sample size of one, but I wouldn't be surprised if many others feel the same.",

Visual mode is always a second-class citizen to a well-defined operator IMHO.\r\n\r\n> It sounds more like we want a `g:` operator that allows any `:` command to be invoked as a dot-repeatable operation. Then one could do `g:{motion}sort<cr>`.\r\n\r\nThat would definitely be really interesting (EDIT: Actually, super-cool, now I think about it!)\r\n\r\n> Saving the trouble of typing out \"sort\" is rather low-value for such a nice mapping as `gs`. Organizing imports is more of an LSP or treesitter task, which implies the value of a sort operation has near-term shelf-life as those mature.\r\n\r\nPerhaps. That's very far from the only reason for sorting lists (for example, for many non-programming usecases I like to sort lists in Markdown), but point taken.\r\n\r\nI don't have a super-strong opinion about this. After all, these are only defaults, and I can always remap myself. Just giving you a view from someone who's been using Vim a while and has his fingers hardcoded to `gs` meaning sort ;)",

So I am excited about using `p` this way (as it works by default).\r\n\r\nI just tried the Vim emulation plugins in VS Code and the JetBrains suite, and they both implement Visual-mode `p` \"correctly\", as in, they match the current Vim/Neovim behavior. (Interestingly, as long as we're talking about consistency, VSCodeVim uses the equivalent of `:nnoremap Y y$` and IdeaVim does not.) I think consistency in the text-editing DSL layer is a big strength of the Vim ecosystem, so my humble vote is to leave `p` and `P` alone in Visual mode.",

Meaning if you last ran :s/foo/bar/g to replace all instances of foo in a line with bar, then move your cursor to a different line and press &, it will still only replace the first instance of foo with bar. The :&& ex command does re-use the flags, but is relatively more cumbersome (four key presses rather than one). The latter is much more useful and a more common operation. To regain the original behavior, users can still use the :& ex command.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would make sense to have [`gdefault`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'gdefault') instead of that, because almost all the time I am using `/g`\r\n",
