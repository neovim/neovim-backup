This is only the case for 3 and there is a comment saying that it's to \"remove the ruler\". I also manually switched to 2 and back to 3 and took screenshots right after running `source %` and you can see this effect:\r\n\r\n![laststatus-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28124404/207132340-f0cfcaee-cb0d-4a09-953c-a72e7e5a7b3a.png)\r\n![laststatus-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28124404/207132354-8a74b63f-330c-49a7-9f19-4693eb33f586.png)\r\n\r\nThe message does appear when switching buffers after launching or manually setting `laststatus=3` where clearing the command line doesn't affect the `echo` from the autocmd.\r\n\r\nThe solution is removing the line `clear_cmdline = true;`. I don't think it would break anything and would be consistent with behaviour when `laststatus` is set to any other value than 3, although I'm not sure if there's anything that depends on the current behaviour. If not, it's a trivial change and I can open a PR. Alternatively, if the current behaviour has to stay, I could look into the order in which things happen because the command line is being cleared after the `BufEnter` event fires so there could be some sort of fix there.",
