It should return immediately an error reply explaining that a recovery decision is required. Until the decision is taken, other commands like `nvim_command(\"help recovery\")` should be processed normally.\r\n",

Currently there's only 3:\n\n- nvim_input\n- nvim_get_mode\n- nvim_get_api_info\n\nAll other API functions block while nvim is waiting for input. \n\nTo avoid being blocked in a client, you can use `nvim_get_mode()` which returns a `blocking` flag to detect whether nvim is in a wait-for-input state. If `nvim_get_mode()` returns `blocking=true`, you can send input to nvim (just as a tty/GUI user could send keyboard input) via the async `nvim_input` function, to unblock nvim. (Yes, this is a bit of a hack.)\n\nFuture improvements are planned:\n\n1. Add more non-blocking (\"async\") API functions\n2. Offer a mode where functions return with an error if they would block\n    - Probably this should be controlled by a timeout limit.\n3. Reduce the cases where nvim blocks for a long time.

If the engine is waiting for input this should be known immediately in the engine somehow without a delay (in most cases).\r\n\r\nNvim knows it's blocked, but maybe it's only blocked for a 10 ms. In that case rather than return an error, it would wait 10ms then proceed as normal.",
