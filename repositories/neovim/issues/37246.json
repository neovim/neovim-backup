    "body": "### Problem\n\nHello,\n\nWhen saving terminals inside sessions, they get restored with their \"original\" working directory. There's no way to \"update\" the directory once a term is created. To be clear, I'm not referring to `cd` - it changes the directory within the shell, but vim \"can't see it\" (to the extent of updating that buffer's `cwd`), and that's exactly the point of this issue.\n\nAdditionally, an API for getting the working directory would also be useful. Currently, one has to parse the buffer's URI. My concern with this solution is mostly cross compatibility across Unix and windows (though might not be a big deal in practice...)\n\nRelated issues:\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3294\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3278\n\nTo be 100% clear with the scenario I'm talking about:\n1. `nvim --clean`\n2. `:terminal`\n3. `:mksession`\n4. `cd foo/bar` inside terminal\n5. `mksession!` - Oh no, the terminal does not get saved with `foo/bar` as its directory!\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- `cwd` (?) could be a buffer local variable for terminals\n- Assigning it to a value would somehow update the buffer's `cwd` (and its URI (?), so it can be restored)\n- Would allow creating an autocmd to update the `cwd` with `TermRequest` + `OSC 7`\n\nAlternatively, an API function could be exposed (creating functions just for that sounds awkward, but I'm not familiar with the terminal internals to make a competent proposal)",

Or rather, not by itself. My main concern is the scenario I described in the \"Problem\" section: restoring the `cwd` when restoring a session. To me, that seems more closely tied to terminal's lifecycle:\n\nIf the URI is not updated when changing the directory, when restoring the session with something like[^1]\n```vim\nif bufexists(fnamemodify(\"term://~//22770:/bin/fish\", \":p\")) | buffer term://~//22770:/bin/fish | else | edit term://~//22770:/bin/fish | endif\n```\nThe buffer would be restored with its original `cwd` (here, `~`) anyway.\n\nIf there was an external mechanism (e.g., a buffer local variable) to set the `cwd`, how would it work in this scenario? When the buffer is restored, the URI also contains the command, and then the terminal would run it straightaway, leaving no \"room\" for updating the `cwd`.\n\nThe only way I see #33320 working for this use case is if we get rid of the `cwd` in the URI, as you suggested in [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33320#issuecomment-3564819483).\n\n\n[^1]: Extracted from sample `Session.vim`",
