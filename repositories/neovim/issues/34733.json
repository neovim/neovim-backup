    "body": "### Problem\n\nIn Japanese, half-width katakana and voicing mark are displayed in 2 characters wide, and Neovim also showed them as expected too. However, it is not the case with Neovim v0.11.0 and after.\n\nThe problem is, terminals show them as two-characters wide. It causes visual corruption in many ways. The following screenshot illustrates how it affects `colorcolumn`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaf40029-89bf-4528-8ceb-8a09688e0922)\n\nIn a real-world text file, the wrong display width often causes unexpected soft wrap and results in TUI corruption on every scroll... just unusable.\n\nNote that the screenshots are Neovim on WSL2 on Windows Terminal, but I confirmed that Neovim with iTerm2 on macOS behaves wrongly as well. Also note that the Windows Terminal itself wrongly renders voicing mark (the mark should be right after character), but it's a separate problem.\n\nFor reference, this is how VS Code renders them:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bad52f9-a4ca-4ae1-88cd-048fe9fb8cc8)\n\nIn addition, `strdisplaywidth('ｶﾞ')` is `2` on v0.10.4 but `1` on v0.11.0.\n\n---\n\nI checked several versions:\n\n- OK: nvim v0.10.4, vim 0.9.1500\n- NG: nvim v0.11.0, v0.11.4, v0.12.0-dev-707+g 807bc00dd6\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a file containing the following contents, namely `halfkana.txt`\n  ```\n  ｱｲｳｴｵ\n  ｶﾞｷﾞｸﾞｹﾞｺﾞ\n  ﾊﾟﾋﾟﾌﾟﾍﾟﾎﾟ\n  \n  \n  vim: set colorcolumn=15:\n  ```\n2. `nvim --clean halfkana.txt`\n3. Notice the corruption.\n4. `echo strdisplaywidth('ｶﾞ')` and see `1`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- Katakana is shown as in v0.10.4.\n- `echo strdisplaywidth('ｶﾞ')` returns `2`.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, 0.9.1500\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04 (WSL 2)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal 1.23.11132.0 & tmux\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nLinuxbrew",

[The definition](https://www.unicode.org/Public/16.0.0/ucd/auxiliary/GraphemeBreakTest.html) says that it is not allowed to break between them.\n\nSo our calculation results in:\n\n1. Check the first codepoint FF76, and its width `1` is added to total width.\n2. Find the next codepoint, but FF76 and FF9E is not allowed to break, so skip the FF9E.\n3. There is no codepoint left, returning total width `1`.\n\nThe problem is, despite FF76 and FF9E is not breakable in the sense of grapheme crusters, ｶ and ｶﾞ should have the different display width.",

            "body": "The Unicode standard doesnt specify anything about how to display\ngraphemes in cells. Indeed it doesn't say anything about terminal\nemulators at all. What it does do is specify how to split up text into\ngraphemes. It also specifies certain properties for codepoints and\ncodepoint clusters, that can be used to try to determine how many cells\nto display a piece of text in.\n\nI have made the effort to standardise this into a simple to follow and\nimplement standard, see https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/#the-algorithm-for-splitting-text-into-cells\n\nBut, from history it is quite clear that it is *hopeless* to try to get\nas diverse an ecosystem as terminals and terminal programs to agree on\nwidths and an algorithm for something as complex as all of human text.\nTherefore, in that same document I linked to above there is a\ncomprehensive solution for this issue, namely allowing terminal programs\nto tell the terminal in how many cells they want each piece of text\nrendered.\nhttps://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/#fixing-the-character-width-issue-for-the-terminal-ecosystem\n\nThat is precisely what I demonstrated in my screenshot above.\nIf nvim used that it could choose whatever width it deemed to be correct\nfor any grapheme and not care what the terminal thinks is the correct\nwidth.\n\nNow to the question of what the width of this particular pair of code\npoints should be. There are currently two general purpose (ignoring some\nniche ones like regional indicators) mechanisms in the unicode standard\nthat are used to modify the cell width of a grapheme. The default width\nfor all graphemes is 1 cell.\n\nThe first mechanism is east asian width and the second is\nemoji presentation. The latter is not applicable here. The former\npotentially is, but as it stands, there is no rule anywhere in\nEastAsianWidth.txt that says this combination should be wide\n(as far as I know, please correct me if I am wrong).\nIn the absence of such a rule it has to be 1 cell wide.\n\nI strongly suggest you do not start making up your own rules for how\nwide particular graphemes should be. That way lies utter chaos. The\ncorrect solution would be to petition the Unicode consortium to add\nextra rules to EastAsianWidth.txt for use in terminals or similar\nmonospaced contexts.\n\nThat is likely to be a lot of effort, probably leading nowhere, so\ninstead you can also consider using the width part of the text sizing\nprotocol which will allow you to at least render such things correctly on\nsupporting terminals which currently are kitty and foot, but I expect\nthat set will increase with time. As it stands you will always be wrong\nin some subset of terminals no matter what you do. With the text sizing\nprotocol or something like it, at least there is a path to a fully\nrobust solution to this entire class of issues.\n",

If there are combining marks you\nfeel should not behave as non spacing marks, then make the case for\nthem. As I stated in my spec I am open to revisions to it. Revisions\nbased on public discussion by people with knowledge of the languages and\nscripts involved.\n\nI know of no combining mark that actually should be rendered in a\nwhole extra cell, aka one that *doubles* the width of the preceding\ncharacter. If you do by all means make a case for it. \"Existing\npractice\" is completely undefined since most people in this space\nhaven't even considered these issues let alone made an informed choice\non them. So existing practice is just whatever corner cases fall through\neach individual implementations algorithm.\n\n>\n> > consider using the width part of the text sizing protocol\n>\n> This is a very good idea and something we will look into, but neovim also wants to support the preexisting terminals where this issue is reported.\n\nThe only way to do that, is to maintain compatibility tables for every\nterminal emulator and terminal emulator version.

I also found a sentence which call it a *outlier*.\n\n> Linebreak uses the CM class, which includes all Mc, Mn, and Me characters, plus some others. In order for it to actually  not break default grapheme clusters, it needs to include all of the Grapheme_Extend characters. With all but 2 characters it does. The Grapheme_Extend characters includes Mn, Me, and Other_Grapheme_Extend. The first two are included already in CM. The Other_Grapheme_Extend mostly includes Mc characters, which are also in CM. **The only 2 outliers are:**\n>\n> FF9E ; Other_Grapheme_Extend # Lm HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK\n> FF9F ; Other_Grapheme_Extend # Lm HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK\n\n(from https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03106-lb6-issue.htm)\n\nThe same goes true for FF9F.\n\nConsidering that, counting FF76+FF9E as 2 cell wide is very natural for me.\n\n## References\n\n- https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/EastAsianWidth.txt\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten\n- https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03106-lb6-issue.htm\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21722729/what-is-the-difference-between-combining-characters-and-grapheme-extenders-i",
