(I'm not enough of a kernel expert to know whether it's guaranteed that the responses from other terminals will be contained in one ```read()``` call, but it happens to be the case.)\r\n\r\nNeovim will crash when only ```^[]11;rgb:``` is in the rbuffer.\r\nThe loop will be entered https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/input.c#L411\r\nBut there is nothing left to read https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/input.c#L422\r\nSo ```count``` will stay ```0```\r\nAnd the assertion ````count && count <= buf->size```` inside https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/input.c#L445 will trigger.",

I've not logged the keys in any way, but a character gets overwritten with `g` and then the cursor moves back to the start of the word.  So I've deduced `rgb`.  If I then type `:` and hit up to see the last command I see `:1e1e/1e1e/1e1e`\n\nI'm using Windows Terminal on Windows 11, connecting to a Centos Stream 9 server.  $TERM is `xterm-256color` (though I can't find where this is set - nothing in `/etc` or `~`?\n\nAny help appreciated.  When I notice its happened it's no big deal (`u` happily undoes it), but when I don't notice, eurgh, infuriating!",
