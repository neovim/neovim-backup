Yes, position is set correctly, I did not change the codebase at all while updating.\n\nAll I did was update from 0.10.4 to 0.11. After 5 hours trying to solve it, I have no clue what is happening. I tried updating everything, reinstalling the markdown grammars, etc. The mystery persists.\n\nI read the news and deprecations notes but I do not see anything that would affect `get_node()` directly.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUnfortunately I struggle to make `get_node()` work at all with the minimal template.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`get_node` to return adequate Markdown nodes like any other filetype.\n\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nIrrelevant\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.3.2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niterm\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew",

Note in `:h vim.treesitter.get_node` about `...parse()` did not change\n    - Yet something must have changed since 0.11 broke my code\n    - Is it documented somewhere, in the news note, ...?\n2. This same doc note might be misleading\n    - `...is not known to be parsed by, e.g., an active highlighter...`\n    - Doesn't it sound like loading and displaying the buffer with syntax highlighting is enough?\n3. Why was I struggling exclusively with Markdown?\n    - I tried so many filetypes, none required `parse()` to work properly\n\nAnswers to those questions should be enough to close the issue üôè",
