    "body": "### Problem\n\nI failed to find a way a native lsp feature to scroll docs. Apparently you have to enter the docs by pressing the same keymap twice, then scroll normally, and then you also have to jump out of the floating window. I don't like it, because it forces me to use additional keymaps when I just want to scroll down the docs once or twice. I saw someone mentioned that the coc.nvim plugin does have this feature. And from what I've read it jumps into the floating window, scrolls and then jump out of it. Although, when I used it I didn't notice anything like that — it just scrolls, and I loved it. At least `<c-f>` and `<c-b>` worked, and this was enough for me (at least from what I can remember). If a user wants to copy something from the docs, then the double keymap press to hop into it can still be used. I also didn't find how to scroll docs when using nvim-cmp, I only know that I can scroll it up and down with Lua API (autocompletion docs in insert mode), but it doesn't work for Neovim's LSP hover docs window.\r\n\r\nRelated links:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15092\r\nhttps://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/issues/1410\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe feature can be implemented in 2 ways, I suppose:\r\n1. add a scroll function that would do \"jump in, scroll, jump out\" action\r\n2. add a proper docs scroll for a floating window without entering it\r\n\r\nThe first one should be much easier. The second probably would require quite a bit of discussion about which windows can be scrolled this way and the API.\r\n\r\nI haven't used VS Code in a long time, but I bet you can scroll in the floating windows there, when you hover over something. I think this feature is essential for the DX, and I am constantly reminded that it doesn't exist when I want to use it.",

A general solution that can be obviously used for non-hover-docs stuff. Though a dedicated `vim.lsp.buf.scroll_docs(number)` would be super convenient. It probably will include some additional logic, like automatically using the docs window that appeared after the call of `vim.lsp.buf.hover()`.\r\n\r\n> One workaround that you can use even currently is to use mouse\r\n\r\nThis workaround only works if I use a mouse, and I don't use a mouse. I use touchpad, but even it I use very rarely. Also, IMO, using mouse to scroll in docs window is probably slower than going into the docs window with an additional keymap (then scrolling with keymaps) and jumping out of it after with another keymap.",

The `KK` idiom is a very nice, ergonomic compromise.\r\n\r\n> you have to enter the docs by pressing the same keymap twice, then scroll normally, and then you also have to jump out of the floating window. I don't like it, because it forces me to use additional keymaps when I just want to scroll down the docs once or twice\r\n\r\nYou don't like `K<c-f>`, so you are requesting that the LSP defaults claim `<c-f>` while the doc hover is visible? And then we would have the inverse problem, which is that now `<c-f>` doesn't do what it's supposed to do, for people who expect it to behave normally. \r\n\r\nYou are asking for \"docs hover visible\" to be a special mode. You can already opt-in to that \"mode\" by hitting `KK`. Or use the mouse scroll, which already works as you expect.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nWe could improve the situation by making it easy to exit the popup (*when it's focused*), perhaps mapping (buffer-local in the popup) one or more of `K`, `<esc>`, `<tab>`.\r\n\r\nEdit: `q` already serves that purpose: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/30347",

            "body": "> The `KK` idiom is a very nice, ergonomic compromise.\r\n\r\nCounterpoint: the `KK` idiom only seems ergonomic because you're used to it and you've accepted its limits.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, once users open a hover window with `K`, they only want to be able to do two things: (1) scroll through the text in the window and (2) close the window. Compare this with a code split, where users will likely want to edit and delete text in both parts of the split. Or even compare it with a split showing `:help`, where users often want to jump around using `:helptags`. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it never makes sense to (try to) edit, delete, or navigate the text in a hover window opened by `K`. (Maybe sometimes it makes sense to yank the text from such a window? I've never done it, but other people may.)\r\n\r\nRight now, the only built-in way to do (1) or (2) is the `KK` idiom, and so—yes—the idiom is helpful. But this thread, the plugin code in `noice`, the user configuration code quoted here, and [Stackexchange questions like this one](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/37225), suggest that (many?) people would like to be able to scroll the text in the window and close the window *without ever entering the window*.\r\n\r\n> # Proposal\r\n> We could improve the situation by making it <easier?> to exit the popup, perhaps mapping `K` and/or `<esc>` and/or `<tab>`.\r\n\r\n+1 There's definitely some demand for this. See, e.g., the [Stackexchange question I linked above](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/37225). (Also, there seem to be several ways to exit the hover window once you are in it: at least `q`, `:q`, and `:bd` work. Are those documented somewhere? I figured them out through trial and error, but maybe I missed some obvious docs.)\r\n\r\nI'd argue that it would be an even bigger improvement if it were possible to close the floating window without entering it. Using some of the code from this thread, here's how I handle that currently.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n---Closes a floating window without entering it.\r\n---@param win_id integer\r\nlocal close_window = function(win_id)\r\n    if not vim.api.nvim_win_is_valid(win_id) then\r\n        vim.keymap.del(\"n\", \"<Leader>;\", { buffer = true })\r\n        return\r\n    end\r\n    vim.api.nvim_win_close(win_id, false)\r\nend\r\n\r\n--- Overrides the default LSP floating window handler to add keymaps and window options.\r\n---@param handler fun(err: any, result: any, ctx: any, config: any): integer?, integer?\r\n---@return fun(err: any, result: any, ctx: any, config: any)\r\nlocal function float_handler(handler, focusable)\r\n    -- Omitted code...\r\n\r\n    return function(err, result, ctx, config) -- the new handler\r\n        -- Omitted code...\r\n        local bufnr, winnr = handler(err, result, ctx, config)\r\n\r\n        -- Return if the buffer or window is not created.\r\n        if not bufnr or not winnr then\r\n            return\r\n        end\r\n\r\n       -- Omitted code and keymaps...\r\n        vim.keymap.set(\"n\", \"<Leader>;\", function()\r\n            close_window(winnr)\r\n        end, { buffer = true })\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\nvim.lsp.handlers[\"textDocument/hover\"] =\r\n    float_handler(vim.lsp.handlers.hover, false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n As someone says much earlier in the discussion, this isn't so difficult. But it took me a long time to put together all the pieces of how to do it. I definitely think it would improve the UX of these floating windows if users didn't have to enter a hover window to close it (or scroll it, for that matter).\r\n",

Mapping `<esc>` _in the float_ to close it would indeed be a reasonable UX improvement. (It's much harder to close inactive floats, because which one would you want to target? Every time you think you have a clear answer, someone will come up with another edge case where that would be wrong ;))",
