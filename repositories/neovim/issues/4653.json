Looking at [this part of buf_write](/neovim/neovim/blob/de1084f3c48816e96be3cac28bcf56bd321ad800/src/nvim/fileio.c#L2360-L2363):\r\n```c\r\n  /*\r\n   * Set '[ and '] marks to the lines to be written.\r\n   */\r\n  buf->b_op_start.lnum = start;\r\n  buf->b_op_start.col = 0;\r\n  buf->b_op_end.lnum = end;\r\n  buf->b_op_end.col = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to avoid this block of code, and I'm not familiar enough with the code base to say how best to fix this. Another argument to `buf_write` which allows us to specify or preserve the `'[` and `']` marks, maybe?",

That's really convenient in one sense, because you just use the latter to represent the former.  When you use `yy`, the range of that operation is the current line, so the marks are automatically set to that line.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that since those two concepts are conflated, you have to play whack-a-mole with figuring out what should be affected by `:lockmarks`.\r\n\r\nMy current patch _only_ adds knowledge of `:lockmarks` to `buf_write()` and `readfile()`.  Then fixing the diff commands is easy -- temporarily enable `lockmarks` in `diff_write()`.\r\n\r\nI'll submit a PR for this limited change upstream, once I write some tests, and see what Bram says.",
