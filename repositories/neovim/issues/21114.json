I propose we also allow sorting by diagnostic source. According to this [person](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15685#issuecomment-921918266), a function was deemed unneeded here, however this additional use case might encourage the use of a generic sort function.\r\n\r\n**Wish statement**\r\nI'd like to be able to sort diagnostic messages by their source, prioritizing, for example, those messages that come from typescript over those that come from eslint.",
