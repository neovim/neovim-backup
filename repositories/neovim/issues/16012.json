    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Feature description\r\n\r\n`complete` is an option that specifies how ins-completion works in vim, more precisely the places that are going to be scanned when `CTRL-N` and `CTRL-P` are used.  The lsp omnifunc (`vim.lsp.omnifunc`) added in 0.5 works really well for people who prefer the builtin completion. My proposal is to add another flag (`set complete+=o`), that would allow the user to receive the omnifunc completion items directly when pressing `CTRL-N` and `CTRL-P`, so that you wouldn't need to press `CTRL-X CTRL-O`. There is already similar support for scanning tags through the \"t\" or \"]\" flags.\r\n\r\nI tried to add the feature myself, but I gave up as I could not get the completion to work as expected with `set complete=o`. \r\nI've also identified one place where changes could be required ([here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/33e79237bc003e8d6d556bf1b6a6e292bb8945e5/src/nvim/edit.c#L4154)). It would be helpful if someone with more experience with the builtin completion could chime in.\r\n### Proposal\r\n1. Omnifunc flag for `complete` option (use case: `set complete=o`, `set complete+=o`)",

Lots of plugins are doing this already, we need to hear from them if there are some key core changes that would make this concept more reliable / routine / ergonomic / idiomatic.",
