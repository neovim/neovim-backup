Corrections welcome unless they are nit-picks.\n\n# Problem\n\nThe C core of nvim has been armored by a lot of static analysis and compiler flags, which has greatly improved quality. But C still has these problems:\n\n- crashes from invalid pointers, arrays not bounds-checked\n- nul-terminated strings are awkward and have a perf cost\n- memory management takes effort and asan doesn't detect all the leaks\n- lack of modern language abstractions (e.g. generics) makes particular parts of the code over complicated and specialized (e.g. marktree, Lua/vimscript bridge).\n\n# Goal\n\nThe strategy of Nvim has always been to lift logic out of C and into Lua where possible. And that still looks like a productive path. But if there is a \"better C\" which allows us to completely *freeze* the remaining C bits and shift to the \"better C\", at near-zero cost, then we should consider that.\n\nC gives us the following benefits:\n\n- broad cross-platform support\n- fast builds\n- leverage existing C codebase\n\n# Proposal\n\nThis issue evaluates whether we can maintain the above benefits, while gaining new ones, by leveraging:\n\n## rust\n\n- pros\n    - tooling\n    - rich type system\n    - borrow checker gives strong guarantees\n    - language level macros\n    - large collection of libraries \n- cons\n    - slow build times\n    - interop with C libraries has nonzero friction\n    - mediocre cross-compiling support\n\n## odin\n\n- pros\n    - Simpler language (vs zig)\n    - Easy interop with C\n    - Supports defer and different allocators like Zig\n    - Good performance and error messages\n    - Fast compilation\n    - Has bounds checking and all the usual modern goodies\n- cons\n    - cross-compiling: can compile to other targets but it only compiles into objects, you have to have the platform's linker to be able to link it.\n    - not 1.0 (but the creator has stated that the language is pretty much done)\n    - No build system or package manager\n\n## zig\n\n- pros\n    - comptime\n      - replaces the Lua generator scripts that create C code (e.g. `gen_api_dispatch.lua`).\n    - zero-friction interop with legacy C code/libraries\n    - easy cross-compile to mac/linux/win, from a single CI job #26455 \n    - can replace CMake #26455\n- cons\n    - still in beta\n    - tooling not as good as C or Rust (e.g. LSP)\n\n\n## c++\n\n- cons\n    - conflicts with Lua's garbage collector, because it is garbage\n\n\n\n---\n\nprevious: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8669\n",

            "body": "In terms of evaluating the languages, here are my thoughts:\n\nC++ is the most 'obvious' choice, but it strikes me as just trading one flavour of brittle for another, and seeing as the issue doesn't list any pros nor elaborates on the con(s), I assume there's not much desire present to discuss it as a serious option, so I will mainly focus on Zig and Rust.\n\nI don't have very deep knowledge of Zig as a language, but purely in terms of tooling, moving parts of C to Zig would be significantly easier/faster especially early on, due to its first-class C integration. However, due to the language being in beta, and there being no indication of a stable release in the foreseeable future (the 1.0.0 GitHub milestone sits at 0% complete, with hundreds of issues assigned to it) and due to the fact that the language addresses the issues outlined with at least some caveats (e.g. memory management is still largely manual, strings still need to be utf-8 validated, Zig generics work *very* differently from most modern languages), it's difficult to say whether things would remain smooth sailing into the long term.\n\nI do have a lot of experience with Rust, and while I do think that adopting Rust's tooling and build system into Neovim's codebase would undoubtedly come with a significant upfront cost, in terms of bridging to C code, I think Rust would be very well equipped to handle Neovim's dependencies like Lua(jit), UTF-8 handling, libuv, etc, which could open the door to large, favorable refactors across the codebase, especially as Neovim's \"style\" (for lack of a better word) of C is already decently modernized, meaning the \"friction\" mentioned would be mitigated somewhat.\n\nAs a contributor, I am eager to put my money where my mouth is. While my contributions to Neovim have been relatively small thus far, primarily on the Lua side, since I don't have the time to fully immersive myself in Neovim's C codebase, adding a high level language (particularly Rust in my case, but Zig potentially also) would mean I could dedicate significantly more time and energy to the project, something that I would be very happy (even actively excited) to do.",

The syntax simplicity and fast learning curve (for those know C at least) might be a factor worth considering to make the transition easier for existing contributors.\nAt the same time, Go has just enough additional abstraction to move faster and with safety. The tooling is also decent (maybe not as good as Rust in that regard though).\nGarbage collection is a pain sometimes, but I am not sure how critical of a drawback it might be in case of Neovim.",

So is the project willing to follow the rat race of zig changing and semantics possibly changing? (there's issues about changing semantics, where big zig projects list their pet peeves).\n\nAlong with the fact that despite zls being quite decent ish, it still breaks with comptime stuff and the language relies quite heavily on it.\n\n---\nWith the unbiased stuff out of the way. I personally find Odin a better \"better C\" language, so that's the language I would vouch for, and it's also tested in production through the JangaFX programs.\n\nIt doesn't have comptime like zig, but honestly there's nothing wrong with generating code through lua or a separate program.\n\nPros:\n- Simpler language\n- Easy interop with C\n- Supports defer and different allocators like Zig\n- Good performance and error messages\n- Fast compilation\n- Has bounds checking and all the usual modern goodies\n\nCons:\n- Also not 1.0 but quite stable, the creator has stated that the language is pretty much done and there's only a few roadblocks for 1.0 afaict\n- No build system or package manager (can be a pro for some)",

            "body": "Is there a reason C++ has been dismissed out of hand? It is frankly the most practical option:\n\n1. The **quality of tools** and libraries are peerless and they continue to benefit from large investments of time and money from their users and benefactors. Compilers, debuggers, IDE's, books, thousands of libraries; the collective effort of huge numbers of people cannot be matched by the passionate few no matter how dedicated. What happens if the company/community behind language X peters out? Or performance gains don't materialize and you have to hack around them? Bugs in popular tools get fixed more quickly.\n2. It's **more familiar to C programmer**s than having to learn something completely new.\n3. It's **popular** and more people will want to work on Neovim if they don't have to learn a new language to do it. And the time invested in learning a widely used standard pays off more than a niche alternative.\n4. It is better than C. **Error handling is *much* better**, whether you use exceptions or (std::optional)[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional.html]/(std::expected)[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected.html]/etc.\n5. It's **supported everywhere**. Less popular platforms won't have to deal with outdated or unsupported tools.\n6. Plenty of people to commiserate with. It is a known quantity. It has problems (groan, I known), but at least you won't have to figure them out yourself. It your use case runs into issues it's less likely someone else has encountered (and solved) it. Smaller projects/languages have less developer effort behind them: they may not prioritize or simply might not have time to fix your problem. It's more likely you'll have to take a crash course in that project's technical debt because the build dies for mysterious reasons when the stars are not aligned with #FIXME race condition. The most obscure template error probably has a stackoverflow answer references it somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, if you disagree with all of the above, I'm a Haskell programmer and strongly recommend it for this and all your other programming needs.\n",

It just works* without having to fiddle with external dependencies and Windowisms to get a successful build. I plan to write up my observations in more detail (let me know if you prefer that in a discussion or broken into issues). There are caveats like certain things haven't been yet implemented in the build like copying over the runtime files directory and a lot of tests fail because they depend on linux coreutils, but those can easily be fixed. Also, I created a fork, which copyies runtime files and other files to the correct folders, and it was able to run my normal nvim config and I only noticed one bug which was a line number visual glitch.\n\nEdit: I created the discussion at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/36835",
