Corrections welcome unless they are nit-picks.\n\n# Problem\n\nThe C core of nvim has been armored by a lot of static analysis and compiler flags, which has greatly improved quality. But C still has these problems:\n\n- crashes from invalid pointers, arrays not bounds-checked\n- nul-terminated strings are awkward and have a perf cost\n- memory management takes effort and asan doesn't detect all the leaks\n- lack of modern language abstractions (e.g. generics) makes particular parts of the code over complicated and specialized (e.g. marktree, Lua/vimscript bridge).\n\n# Goal\n\nThe strategy of Nvim has always been to lift logic out of C and into Lua where possible. And that still looks like a productive path. But if there is a \"better C\" which allows us to completely *freeze* the remaining C bits and shift to the \"better C\", at near-zero cost, then we should consider that.\n\nC gives us the following benefits:\n\n- broad cross-platform support\n- fast builds\n- leverage existing C codebase\n\n# Proposal\n\nThis issue evaluates whether we can maintain the above benefits, while gaining new ones, by leveraging:\n\n## rust\n\n- pros\n    - tooling\n    - rich type system\n    - borrow checker gives strong guarantees\n    - language level macros\n    - large collection of libraries \n- cons\n    - slow build times\n    - interop with C libraries has nonzero friction\n    - mediocre cross-compiling support\n\n## zig\n\n- pros\n    - comptime\n      - replaces the Lua generator scripts that create C code (e.g. `gen_api_dispatch.lua`).\n    - zero-friction interop with legacy C code/libraries\n    - can easily cross-compile to mac/linux/win, from a single CI job\n    - can replace CMake: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28344/\n- cons\n    - still in beta\n    - tooling not as good as C or Rust (e.g. LSP)\n\n\n## c++\n\n- cons\n    - conflicts with Lua's garbage collector, because it is garbage\n\n\n\n---\n\nprevious: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8669\n",

            "body": "In terms of evaluating the languages, here are my thoughts:\n\nC++ is the most 'obvious' choice, but it strikes me as just trading one flavour of brittle for another, and seeing as the issue doesn't list any pros nor elaborates on the con(s), I assume there's not much desire present to discuss it as a serious option, so I will mainly focus on Zig and Rust.\n\nI don't have very deep knowledge of Zig as a language, but purely in terms of tooling, moving parts of C to Zig would be significantly easier/faster especially early on, due to its first-class C integration. However, due to the language being in beta, and there being no indication of a stable release in the foreseeable future (the 1.0.0 GitHub milestone sits at 0% complete, with hundreds of issues assigned to it) and due to the fact that the language addresses the issues outlined with at least some caveats (e.g. memory management is still largely manual, strings still need to be utf-8 validated, Zig generics work *very* differently from most modern languages), it's difficult to say whether things would remain smooth sailing into the long term.\n\nI do have a lot of experience with Rust, and while I do think that adopting Rust's tooling and build system into Neovim's codebase would undoubtedly come with a significant upfront cost, in terms of bridging to C code, I think Rust would be very well equipped to handle Neovim's dependencies like Lua(jit), UTF-8 handling, libuv, etc, which could open the door to large, favorable refactors across the codebase, especially as Neovim's \"style\" (for lack of a better word) of C is already decently modernized, meaning the \"friction\" mentioned would be mitigated somewhat.\n\nAs a contributor, I am eager to put my money where my mouth is. While my contributions to Neovim have been relatively small thus far, primarily on the Lua side, since I don't have the time to fully immersive myself in Neovim's C codebase, adding a high level language (particularly Rust in my case, but Zig potentially also) would mean I could dedicate significantly more time and energy to the project, something that I would be very happy (even actively excited) to do.",

The syntax simplicity and fast learning curve (for those know C at least) might be a factor worth considering to make the transition easier for existing contributors.\nAt the same time, Go has just enough additional abstraction to move faster and with safety. The tooling is also decent (maybe not as good as Rust in that regard though).\nGarbage collection is a pain sometimes, but I am not sure how critical of a drawback it might be in case of Neovim.",

Zig has a compelling solution for C code, one that other languages do not provide.",
