The problem is, most servers don't have support for `textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta` and nvim will try to request and process full semantic tokens response at every buffer change. Even though the request is debounced, there will be noticeable lagging experience if the token response is quite large due to the large file.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nDisabling it for large file could be a workaround; but I think supporting `textDocument/semanticTokens/range` is another solution. We can only request semantic tokens for visible screen (possibly with buffer).",
