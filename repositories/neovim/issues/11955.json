    "body": "I've noticed that Neovim stopped writing the ShaDa file, and when running `:wshada` it showed:\r\n\r\n> E138: All /home/user/.local/share/nvim/shada/main.shada.tmp.X files exist, cannot write ShaDa file!\r\n\r\nThe error message is a bit confusing, and does not show up with `:h E138` (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/492f2cfeff9a8ed295d2cbf3f4197a91654e07ca?#commitcomment-37510589), but looking at the file system showed this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw------- 1 user user 1.5K Jul 20  2017 /home/user/.local/share/nvim/shada/main.shada.tmp.a\r\nâ€¦\r\n-rw------- 1 user user    0 Feb 25 18:58 /home/user/.local/share/nvim/shada/main.shada.tmp.z\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. tempfiles with `[a-z]` in the end do exist already.\r\n\r\n1. I think Neovim should clean out old tempfiles here automatically, i.e. start again using `a` if `z` is used already - especially when they are that old already.\r\n\r\n2. There should be an error about this during shutdown always.\r\nI see it with `nvim -u NONE` on `:q`, but with `nvim -u NORC` it only flashes up, but does not wait for ENTER.  So some default plugin appears to make a difference there.\r\n(With my config it is not visible at all, but that might be due to lazyredraw or similar)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.5.0-398-g78ec95ce7-dirty\r\n",
