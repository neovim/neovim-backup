When executing the first line both `Foo` and `Bar` are shown\n2. When executing the notify line the `An error` is properly highlighted in red\n3. When using a command that streams output (such as fugitive's `Git push`) the message is properly formated upon completion\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9ac77c-1432-4539-9fb7-73e00b774658)\n\nOn the other hand if I enable the new grid with `require('vim._extui').enable({})` then, as in the GIF, we see that\n1. The first line echo is cutoff and a `spill` indicator is shown. We need to press `g<` to see full message. Personally I find this counterintuitive since as I user I'm explicitly requesting the print. \n2. When executing the notify line the  `An error` is not highlighted in red.  ✅\n3. When using a command that streams output the whole mangled/incomplete output is shown  ✅\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d595c8a8-0c83-4951-a8d5-a386819c8c2b)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee above\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the vim._extui to behave a bit more like the old message area.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-343+g1c96b72dfa\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo idea\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ntmux 3.5a\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256\n\n### Installation\n\nAUR",

            "body": "Hi @luukvbaal! Thanks for all the hard work in this feature. I believe we are close to closing this issue. I have a couple of questions:\n1. Is there a simple way to detect if a message has a spill indicator? I'm using this rather convoluted logic to do that https://github.com/petobens/dotfiles/blob/710f37ee568ee787fac0feeb2499c61f0b8e1b35/nvim/init.lua#L21-L39 but was wondering whether there was a simpler way? Maybe using  `nvim_echo` as per you previous suggestion as in https://github.com/petobens/dotfiles/blob/8600e4f7f1a74efc5917821df0d0c52825bf483a/nvim/init.lua#L21-L34 is everything we can do.\n2. This is maybe more a feature request than an issue but is there some way to show the tail rather than head of a spilled message? My use case is reflected in the GIF: when I do a git push with fugitive I would like to see whether push was successful rather than the initial `encripted with...` message\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a51f7afc-8a59-4d2f-bb52-60585e8a173e)\n\nAnother  way to put 2. is that if there is an error but something gets printed before then there is no clear indication of such error in the spill message:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59067df0-67ed-4184-a865-cf366ec0ab82)\n\nFor instance in the image I see `action_palette[+18]` but if I don't actually open the menu and scroll down then I don't see the error.",

            "body": "Thanks @petobens. Since you're overriding `vim.print()`, is your issue specifically with that? I think it could make sense to assign the `list_cmd` to it, as it claims to \"pretty print\" its arguments. Problem is that we can't currently assign a different kind to `vim.print()` than regular `print()`, which I believe shouldn't be shown in full by default, so we might need `vim._with({msg_kind})` for that.\n\nWe cannot guess where the most important part of a message is. I don't think it makes sense to let the user configure to show the tail.\n",
