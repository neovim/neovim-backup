This makes it a bit tricky to \"pause\" the viewport if the buffer exceeds 'scrollback'.\r\n\r\nBut I agree it should not scroll if cursor isn't at end-of-buffer. We could switch to an \"alternate\" buffer with a copy of the \"paused\" scrollback (thus for `scrollback=1000` the buffer would have 1000 lines).",
