One way to do this might be for the UI to pass along locally-discovered addresses when it first connects to a remote.\n    - If another server is started after connecting to a remote then it won't show up on the list. To address that, local Nvims could make rpc calls to remote Nvims when they startup.\n- auto-install on remote\n  - P0: auto-install nvim on the remote.\n  - P1: if remote outbound network doesn't work, download locally then upload to remote.\n  - P2: upload user's local config to the remote.",

Notably, remote-nvim.nvim can interface with docker containers and [devpods](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod).\n\nIt would be good to consider potential overlap in functionality with plugins (like remote-nvim.nvim) when designing this, since there are many components in this that would be useful in making other remote editing plugins. (Eg. functions to help install nvim, copy config files, etc.)\n\nSomething else that I'm not seeing mentioned here is cleanup. If nvim is installed on the remote through any method, it would also be nice to have an easy way to remove it from the remote, potentially automatically. I'm imagining something like `rm -rf ~/.nvim-remote/` to clear all session data, along with something like a \"RemoteDisconnectPre\" event that could be used to run it before disconnect.\n\nI think this would be very powerful if it were ever used in combination with something like the `:detach` feature that was proposed in #5035. Very exciting! Looking forward to seeing where this all goes.",
