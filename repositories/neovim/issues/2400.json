    "body": "I often see that undofiles are not being taken into account anymore, which is likely to be caused by changing branches in Git etc, where the file contents then does not match anymore the expected contents - which then causes the undo information to be discarded.\n\nA good workaround for this might be to use additional information in the undo filename, like the current Git branch.  This could be done by allowing to override the `undofile()` function used by Vim.\n\nA better fix might be if Neovim could store multiple branches of the file in the default undo file by itself.  I.e., if there is no entry for the current file's hash, it would create a new entry / root in the undo file.\nWhen you then change back to another branch, the previous undo file entry would be used again.\n",
