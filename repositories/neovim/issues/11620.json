There are many times where I am doing some edits and would like to repeat that action with `.` later in normal mode somewhere else, however often times I end up performing some other edit action so `.` would no longer be relevant but if I could type `q .` then retrieve a list of most recently used editing actions then I would have at my fingertips all past actions and it would be awesome to use anyone at my command\n\n### Expected behaviour\nTyping `q .` would bring up a list of past editing actions that I can press enter to execute immediately just like how `q /` would bring up a list of past searches or `q :` would bring up a list of past executed commands.\n\n\n### Related\n\n- https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4616",

            "body": "Here is a proof of concept: https://asciinema.org/a/IK0MXFdcePbxIRJMK9Q9sTM43\r\n\r\nI didn't open a PR because this implementation https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/3cd9b5c66245ff4954772fc3ab7e7c68347babad has some problems. It saves `old_redobuff` when `ResetRedobuff()` gets called, which is when the recording for `.` begins. Because of this, the history doesn't contain the last two edits, so I had to add them manually when the `dot_hist()` function gets called from the demo.\r\n\r\nTo make it work with the `q:` and `q/` history mechanism, we would need to call [add_to_history](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/bcaff309b6073b66635bd51d6fbd6900f4baba1d/src/nvim/cmdhist.c#L296) from `cmdhist.c` to add edits to the history. \r\nSo we need to know when the recording for a motion/operator stops and add it to the history then, but I'm too new to the code base to know if there is a way to tell when a motion or edit ends, and if it isn't, how to implement it.\r\n",
