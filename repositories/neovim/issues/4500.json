(IE, I run `:ter` then run `img2sixel` on an image)\n\nI suspect the latter would be easier to implement in the short term, while the former requires some API design.\n\nPreferably, whatever is done would support kitty and iterm2 as well in both case 1 and 2.\n\nAlso, ImageMagick supports sixel encoding, so if cropping or something else isn't easy, that library could be used to decode the image, manipulate it then re-encode it.",

There's already plugins that support this. Forwarding all three images is a different (much simpler) ask - though some image readjustment would be mandatory, since nvim is a terminal multiplexer. This image readjustment would be mandatory in both cases, with any and all of the three protocols.\n\n> But sixels are inferior in basically every respect to other alternatives\n\nI agree that sixels are inferior. They're really slow and look bad, but there's two reasons I personally find them useful\n\n1. Sixels work over ssh, Kitty assumes that the images are on the same computer.\n2. see below\n\n> ... alternatives which have equal or greater support.\n\nAccording to the outdated (as in, there are missing terminals here) [list of terminals with sixel support](https://www.arewesixelyet.com), there are (at least) 28 _currently maintained_ sixel terminals (old Dec terminals are used by almost no-one, and thus don't honestly matter). \n\nI can't find a list of supported terminals for iTerm Images, but I remember hearing that there are some, so that's at least 2 (iTerm2 by Apple and whatever else).\n\nThe only list of terminals I could find with Kitty Image support (which, mind you, kitty images are the best choice 80% of the time) is on the official page [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/), which boasts 16 \"applications\" and 4 \"terminals\". Counting those both gives us only 20.\n\nI'm not aware of any other terminal image protocols that are taken seriously.\n\nEDIT: incorrect counts.",
