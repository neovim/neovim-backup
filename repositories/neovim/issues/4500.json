(IE, I run `:ter` then run `img2sixel` on an image)\n\nI suspect the latter would be easier to implement in the short term, while the former requires some API design.\n\nPreferably, whatever is done would support kitty and iterm2 as well in both case 1 and 2.\n\nAlso, ImageMagick supports sixel encoding, so if cropping or something else isn't easy, that library could be used to decode the image, manipulate it then re-encode it.",
