    "body": "### Problem\n\n#23903 reverted the previous change of (#23871) which promoted all three available `positionEncodings` because there was no support for multiple clients with different `positionEncoding`s attached to the same buffer.\r\nFrom looking at the code base each client seems to store it's own `offset_encoding` which is read from the server capabilities or defaults to `utf-16` as the spec demands. Was this implemented after the discussion and would this allow re-enabling the client capabilities for other `positionEncodings`?\r\n\r\nThis would especially make sense for something like rust-analyzer, because the rust spec demands rust files to be utf-8. So the client is working with `utf-8`, the server is working with `utf-8` and both have to convert all character offsets to `utf-16`.\r\n\r\nA somewhat related comment from the rust-analyzer codebase: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/f3d9c9df9010ff4dd7b51f200fc772d38c94f006/crates/rust-analyzer/src/lsp/capabilities.rs#L261\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf possible set the `positionEncodings` client capability to `{ \"utf-8\", \"utf-32\", \"utf-16\" }` or ``{ \"utf-8\", \"utf-16\", \"utf-32\" }``.",
