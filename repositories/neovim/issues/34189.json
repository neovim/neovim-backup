It would be cool if `listchars` color would also change according to `hi Visual` like every other character does. Something similar to emacs.\nMaybe you could add a different highlight group like `ListcharsVisual` which holds the colors.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen you select a block of text and the list is set the characters that are under the selection also have the highlight of the selection and not the default that every other list character has.
