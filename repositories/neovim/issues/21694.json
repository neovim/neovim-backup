So maybe a `⊘` or `-`? Although admittedly the first one is quite visible while second one is not that different from current default `~`.\r\n- If \"doesn't feel garish or overwrought\" has more priority, a full height line `│` might be a good choice.\r\n\r\nTwo observations:\r\n- The middle dot seems to be the most obvious choice for `space`, so using it as default for `eob` is a bit contradictory.\r\n- Judging by the [survey result](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/fa70dc75c475369747d2a485a13303fb#file-neovim-survey-summary_03_separated-listoptions-csv), users use either current default `~` or space.",

In turn, this depends not only a symbol itself but also on its `EndOfBuffer` highlighting. As taking all color schemes into account is not really possible, the default color scheme (and maybe selection of bundled ones) should be used.\r\n\r\n",
