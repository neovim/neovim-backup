    "body": "I don't believe this behavior can be implemented with a plugin (though I've been wrong pretty much every time I've said that when it comes to vim), but it would be helpful to have an `infercase`-like option that would enable tab completion for command mode, but without turning off case sensitivity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `infercase` can be used together with `wildignorecase` to enable smart-case tab completion for regular completions but not for vim commands, while `ignorecase` can be used to enable case-insensitive tab completions for both commands and regular completions, but additionally makes `/` searches case-insensitive.\r\n\r\nThe easiest option is to have either `infercase` or `wildignorecase` (or both together) enable case-insensitive or smart-case tab completion for command mode commands as well, but I don't want to suggest something that some may be vehemently opposed to. If it's any consolation, I don't see (which _probably_ only means I'm wrong and I'm showing my ignorance here) how this can break any scripts or plugins since this would affect TTY behavior only.",
