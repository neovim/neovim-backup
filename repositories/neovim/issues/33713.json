It instead opens the \"C:\\Users\\\\\\<user>\\Documents\" folder. \n\nI have reproduced it on a Windows sandbox with no configuration. The issue still persists in **NVIM v0.12.0-dev-251+gc489b5a3e3**. And the last known working version is **0.10.4**. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim --clean\n:Ex\nx on `test.txt`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`text.txt` should open in _notepad.exe_\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, it is working as expected on vim 9.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11 23H2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal 1.22.11141.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\n-\n\n### Installation\n\nnvim-win64.msi",
