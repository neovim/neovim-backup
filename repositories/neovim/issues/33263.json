A `'fillchars'` option setting could be introduced to allow the user to set this character to whatever's suitable for them (much like for `eob`, `lastline`, &c).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf the setting is called `dwchar`, say, then\n```\nset fillchars+=dwchar:%\n```\nwould show the final character on the line as `%` when any double-width character straddles the right edge of the window.\n",
