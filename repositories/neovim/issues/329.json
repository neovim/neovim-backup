    "body": "Hey Team ! \r\n\r\n**TL;DR** : \r\nStarted porting helpfiles to rst and md formats. Repo is at : https://github.com/Pychimp/neovim-docs\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Better Explanation:\r\n\r\nSo, I have started to port the help files to both rst and md formats. \r\nI have cloned the main neovim/docs [repo](https://github.com/neovim/docs/commit/dc9d7ee48861a7102c50e4a34e2c7d39d5f20ade) (after @rjw57 latest PR was merged in)\r\n\r\nAs @tarruda had mentioned in #106, He wanted to keep the original format. So, what I plan to do, is to convert the help files to rst and md on seperate branches, and then send a PR to the main neovim/docs repo. \r\n\r\n(Meaning, Even after my PR would be merged (Hopefully ! :smile:), The original *.txt **will be** as they are on the master branch, while the converted ones will be on their **own and respective** branches)\r\n## \r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n- The original help format used currently in vim (with `*<tag>*` and `|<tag>|`) is great, and _we_ can stick with those...\r\n- Alternatively, as @Gaelan [mentioned](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/106#issuecomment-35960969), neovim might be able to render out the docs easily (just the way, vim seems to do with the current help format). \r\n\r\n> Why two formats (rst and md), can't you make simply one and then, once that is approved merge it in to main ?\r\n\r\nWell ... The thing is we had a (long) bit of discussion (like this: #207), and I didn't want to waste the team's time by having a flame war like that, which is why I'll make them into rst and md formats. After some time, Should the team decide to choose one format over the other, the rejected one can be dropped off, and the selected one will continue to develop. \r\n\r\n(Plus, I might have some time to kill, and I'm bad at C :sweat_smile: (the C code in this repo does look scary), So, I thought I might help out like this.)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to discuss and let me know, what you guys think ! :smile: \r\n\r\nLink to my repo : https://github.com/Pychimp/neovim-docs\r\n",

In the meantime we can export to stylized HTML: neovim/neovim.github.io#55\n> \n> As an \"authoring\" format vimdoc isn't bad, just a bit limiting. Please re-open on the Neovim main repo if you want to continue this discussion.\n\nContinuing discussion from neovim/docs#5. “Easier merges” sounds like a no excuse after heavy code restyling of Vim codebase. Documentation updates are like 1% of overall changes in upstream Vim patches and are very trivial to merge even if neovim documentation has new format. Reasoning behind ReST + sphinx:\n1. There is some [sphinx extension](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/tree/master) for sphinx ← doxygen integration, so higher-level developer docs may be kept in ReST, available from Neovim help system and link to documentation initially generated by doxygen.\n2. It is completely possible to create a sphinx plugin which will render ReST to Vim doc: one needs to take ASCIIdoc backend to get a good head start. I do not know any head starts for the opposite direction, Vim doc to doxygen or Vim doc to HTML at all: existing solutions only know about inter-documentation links: no external links (generic URLs) and links to non-vim-doc sources.\n3. Sphinx provides things like automatic TOC generation. It is completely possible to make sphinx generate index.txt for us as well. Keeping things located in different places (e.g. TOC and actual sections, command descriptions and command index) in sync is exactly that kind of the job that drives any sane programmer mad.\n4. Sphinx allows creating custom entities so one may use things like <code>:key:`<C-v>`</code> to precisely tag some strings with their meaning and do other processing (e.g. generating links and prepending each command in <code>:cmd:`echo`</code> with a colon as a sigil).\n\nI am not saying anything about markdown here because I know no Sphinx for markdown. For this reason I think that markdown should not be used for non-doxygen documentation. It is also completely possible to convert ReST to markdown loosing those `:cmd:` hints.\n",

Can you say something about this?\n\nNote that I would not say that any of the mentioned issues are stoppers. They just make ReST look slightly better, even though I am not fond of its syntax.\n",

I do not know how github handles local links in ASCIIdoc, but I know that in ReST files links pointing anywhere, but to the current file or path to external source do not work for sure and it is missing all sphinx extensions: check out [powerline documentation](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/blob/develop/docs/source/develop/segments.rst#id3): it is full of links looking like <code>:ref:`caption &lt;label&gt;`</code> pointing nowhere.\n\nThough RTD just runs `sphinx-build` and provides the resulting HTML, it still has amazing functionality provided by Sphinx.

So is there Sphinx equivalent for ASCIIdoc?\n\nOr  is there any other (other than doxygen) equivalent to sphinx for any markup or any working attempt to teach Sphinx non-ReST markup (this should be possible, but writing something like this from scratch is not a fast idea)?\n",

Also in the following example: “Refer to <<document-b.adoc#section-b,Section B>> for more information.” document name is hardcoded.\n\nSecond: Sphinx is capable of automatically generating documentation from sources. This also applies to DOxygen, but Sphinx can work with DOxygen XML output as well (there are at least three plugins for this). Since neovim project contains DOxygen-style documentation in C code stored as comments, as well as Python client either only DOxygen or Sphinx+DOxygen seems to be the most natural choice. (I would actually prefer “only DOxygen”, but cannot find any references that it can use documentation _not_ in source code which is a stopper.)\n\nI have managed to find some discussions about making asciidoctor read documentation from sources, but I do not know how complete these attempts are: [last one](http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Ascii-doctor-and-written-code-td2034.html is from August 2014 and not very active, effectively meaning that they are very far from being complete.\n\n---\n\nSo features of Sphinx:\n1. Integration with DOxygen.\n2. Linking other projects, \n3. Domains feature for linking anything you like.\n4. Mathematical expressions (almost never needed, but may be handy for writing `O(n^2)` so that the HTML result does not suck).\n5. Capable of building project index, as well as TOC tree.\n6. Has better documentation on extending itself (asciidoctor provides a few examples with nearly no explanations or API references, Sphinx _still_ has things like “TODO: expand this”, but its documentation on this matter is more complete).\n7. Sphinx is written and extensible in Python. ASCIIdoctor is written and extensible in Ruby. The problem here is that Googling for “neovim ruby” returns one relevant link: https://github.com/alexgenco/neovim-ruby, and last commit to these bindings was on 24 Jul. On the other hand Python client is developed by @tarruda and at least I know Python as well, which clearly indicates which of (ASCIIdoc, Sphinx) is more likely to be capable of being extended for neovim needs by its developers if required. Please don’t start a holy war here, I am not saying that Ruby is worse language then Python. I am saying it is less familiar.\n8. Asciidoc is written and extensible in Python, but it lacks asciidoctor features and has no commits since Nov 27, 2013.\n9. About extensions: if with Sphinx you have access to the whole _project_ in some places, asciidoctor does not have this option.\n10. Sphinx is as well capable of rendering documentation based on some condition, rendering to man pages, PDF or HTML (3 variants of HTML output, including one big single HTML file).\n11. Various Python-related features:\n    1. Formatting and linking source code (only for Python and probably C and C++ out-of-the-box).\n12. Sphinx is more mature then asciidoctor, has more contributors and extension modules.\n13. And my favourite: there is a version of Sphinx considered stable in Gentoo main portage tree, but only versions considered unstable for asciidoctor.\n\n> Maybe he has some input to give the neovim project on why Asciidoc might work better for us than ReStructuredText.\n\nI am not comparing ASCIIdoc with ReST. I am comparing asciidoc and asciidoctor (primary the second) to Sphinx, because ReST syntax sucks. Software, not formats. Do not mix them, Sphinx /= ReST.\n",

AFAIK it is extensible enough to make this thing possible, but I do not know whether there are any existing projects (except for various Sphinx/doxygen bridge plugins) and how good are they.\n\nI did try using a couple of different bridges between Sphinx and Doxygen, but the Doxygen set up for the project I tried it with was rather large, distributed, and complicated.  Combined with the fact that the few plugins out there to combine Doxygen and Sphinx were still early in development (it was about 2 years ago when I tried this last), I didn't have any luck.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know of any other projects that have tried using pure Sphinx for both the API and user documentation. :-(\n",

            "body": "# Status\r\n\r\n- We have a [parser](https://github.com/neovim/tree-sitter-vimdoc) for vimdoc (:help) file format now, and it is used by [gen_help_html.lua]((https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11967)) to generate HTML. It would be trivial to generate other formats like markdown. \r\n- Format decision: markdown (or a derivative like [markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/))\r\n    - Why: because (1) it is ubiquitous, (2) it looks ok in raw form, (3) see \"Reference\" below.\r\n- Remaining work:\r\n    1. Enhance `:help` and `:helptags` to directly support markdown/rst/?\r\n        - _Extend_ markdown so that we can easily define tags and links in it, analogous to vimdoc's `*tag*` and `|link|` tokens.\r\n    2. _One-time_ conversion of Nvim-owned help docs. For example, convert `api.txt` to `api.md` once, then maintain it as markdown directly.\r\n    3. Vim-owned help docs like `eval.txt` should remain in vimdoc format.\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468213\r\n\r\n- markdown:\r\n  > Last year we (mozilla MDN) [changed the source format for MDN](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/markdown-conversion/) from some extremely messy, WYSIWYG-authored HTML to something that would be easier for authors to use. We considered Asciidoc and reST, and despite its limitations, we chose Markdown (GFM specifically) for two reasons:\r\n  > 1. We get a _lot_ of casual contributors to MDN: about 180-200 unique contributors/month, most of whom we never see again. Almost all of them can contribute much more easily with Markdown than with anything else. Many of these people are unlikely to put even an half an hour into learning a new syntax.\r\n  > 2. Markdown has great tooling support. For example, if we want to run Prettier over our embedded code samples, it's really easy if we are in Markdown. If we are in Markdown we will get nice formatting just about everywhere, including GitHub of course and most people's editors.\r\n- asciidoc:\r\n  > I love Asciidoc, but the tooling is pretty crummy.\r\n  > Seems to have a problem with nesting.\r\n- RsT (RestructuredText)\r\n  > Originally reStructuredText was \"a Python thing\", ... nowadays (thanks to Sphinx?) reStructuredText is also used for big systems-y projects, including the Linux kernel docs and Envoy proxy.\r\n  > I work in an academic setting ... we used reStructuredText ... [contributors] would get demotivated by having to learn the rST syntax and tooling.\r\n  > I gave up and switched from rST and Sphinx to Markdown and MkDocs. We addressed the limitations of Markdown with PyMdown Extensions [3].\r\n- djot\r\n  - The creator of Pandoc is creating a markup language worth looking at: https://djot.net/\r\n- markdoc.dev (stripe)\r\n  - > Anything AsciiDoc can do, Markdoc can be extended to do, from variables through includes.\r\n  - React or HTML output. AST transforms or functions. Upcoming editor support etc.\r\n- MyST https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\r\n  - > the jupyter devs created myst ([https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.h...](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html#syntax-core)), a superset of markdown that has almost all the features of rst, and can embed rst when it falls short.\r\n\r\n",
