I closed this because in the current setup this is a bit of a pain. Adjusting the Lua code isn't the biggest issue. Adjusting the syntax rules on the other hand gets annoying.\r\n\r\nThinking of it, I think the root issue is that the quickfix window basically shows structured data but in an unstructured text format. Defining syntax rules for that is easy if the format is fixed, but if users are able to tweak it (e.g. move the path to the right of the text), things get messy really fast.\r\n\r\nOf course you can opt to just not support that like I did. But then if you want your own quickfix format, you also have to fiddle with the syntax rules.\r\n\r\nI thought about using `conceal`, and wrapping special elements in certain start/end tokens (e.g. `<loc>line:column</loc>`), but that's going to mess things up when you try to yank text from an item. I also think this will introduce issues if the item text includes those tags.\r\n\r\nI guess one option is to not use pre-defined syntax rules, and instead rely on `nvim_buf_add_highlight`. Since you know what goes where when formatting, you could use this to inject the appropriate highlights, provided you clear any existing ones when updating the quickfix list. I don't know if this works if the quickfix list is ever made mutable though.",

To work around that you'd need a fully blown parser. And at that point you basically have a quickfix window displaying structured data, but using hacks to make it show as regular text (instead of this being something NeoVim woud properly support).",

Do we implement this in Lua, or fiddle around with it in C? I'm thinking Lua might be best in case we need to backport quickfix code from Vim\r\n2. We need to change the `qf` syntax rules for this new format.
