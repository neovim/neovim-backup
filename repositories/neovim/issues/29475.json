My understanding was the `detach=false` would always kill all immediate child jobs of Nvim when it is closed (even in a crash). This is supposed to be handled by the OS.\r\n\r\nCan you test with a simpler process? `{ \"kubectl\", \"proxy\", \"--port=0\" }` may be launching its own child processes, which Nvim cannot manage. If that's the case, then you may actually need `deatch=true`.",

Summary: We *always* need `setsid`, thus we always need `detach=true`, thus Nvim must actively kill its immediate children on exit: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/862679c70fa062e567fd7f720f9fd994fa023101/src/nvim/event/process.c#L131-L142\r\n\r\n> My understanding was the `detach=false` would always kill all immediate child jobs of Nvim when it is closed (even in a crash). This is supposed to be handled by the OS.\r\n\r\nWith `detach=false` libuv doesn't call `setsid`, so the process tree is not part of a session/group. So the OS won't kill the tree. As a workaround, on unix we always need to set `UV_PROCESS_DETACHED`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/862679c70fa062e567fd7f720f9fd994fa023101/src/nvim/event/libuv_process.c#L39-L40\r\n\r\nAnd as a result, \r\n\r\n- on exit we need to actively kill immediate children (then the OS will kill the child's \"tree\"), if the `vim.system` \"job\" was started with `detach=false`\r\n    - *internally* we always set `detach=true` for unixes so that libuv does `setsid`. We only *simulate* `detach=false` on exit (and yes this means crashes leave zombies; unavoidable).\r\n- for `detach=true` we simply [skip](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/862679c70fa062e567fd7f720f9fd994fa023101/src/nvim/event/process.c#L136-L138) the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26861\r\n\r\n\r\n",
