Note that the child\r\nprocess will still keep the parent's event loop alive\r\nunless the parent process calls |uv.unref()| on the\r\nchild's process handle.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a workaround to manually kill it on VimLeavePre but I doubt that will run if neovim crashes:\r\n```lua\r\n  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"VimLeavePre\", {\r\n    callback = M.stop_kubectl_proxy(),\r\n  })\r\n```\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-dev\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11 (WSL)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWezterm/20240203-110809-5046fc22\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nsudo apt-get install neovim",

My understanding was the `detach=false` would always kill all immediate child jobs of Nvim when it is closed (even in a crash). This is supposed to be handled by the OS.\r\n\r\nCan you test with a simpler process? `{ \"kubectl\", \"proxy\", \"--port=0\" }` may be launching its own child processes, which Nvim cannot manage. If that's the case, then you may actually need `deatch=true`.",
