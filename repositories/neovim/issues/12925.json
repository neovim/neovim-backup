It's easy to have more information in your statusline than can possibly fit, a long git branch name plus a long file path are enough to fill a single line.  While truncation helps, there is only so much you can truncate before the message becomes useless.  This issue becomes particularly acute when using a display in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese VIM group have prepared a [patch][1] to allow support for this feature, but it has been rejected and not allowed into the Vim core.  \r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nStatuslines are limited to a single line of text.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe ability to set `statuslineheight` as documented in [the patch][1].

            "body": "jdhao, thanks for asking--I really appreciate the attention and thought going into this discussion.  I don't need the full path, but with my monitor in portrait mode I have just over 80 columns of text.  When you add in a branch name in from git following team standards, it looks like `feature/XY-3333-some-name-here-like-this`.  Add in react project file names like `src/components/SomeComponent/subComponent/reducers/someActionName.ts`, already things don't fit with the line number and column of the cursor position, much less the file type, encoding, messages from coc and so forth.\n\nI can't just get by with the file name and not the path, because I have a bunch of files called `index.ts` or `cycles.ts`.\n\nI have copious vertical space, even after splitting my window to keep a shell present below my code.\n\nTo consistently have enough file path visible I had to disable most of the airline defaults.\n\nI know one solution is \"don't structure your projects like that\", but I am using these tools for work and I need to conform to the standards set by my team.  So the simple answer isn't really an option.\n\nI would really love to be able to have the git information back.  The other stuff would be nice, but is far less important.  Perhaps I have an X Y problem, and there is a much better way to go forward than targeting the status line.  If so, I would love to hear an alternative approach.\n\nThanks again for your hard work and attention--this applies to all the neovim contributors, too.\n\n--Edit:\n\nSetting titlestring doesn't do anything noticeable in my tmux session.  Maybe there's a configuration thing I should change, I didn't find anything after a few minutes, I'll keep investigating, though.  It would be better than nothing, but since I have multiple buffers visible with horizontal splits, it would only show one path at the top of the window (or maybe at the bottom in the session list from tmux.",
