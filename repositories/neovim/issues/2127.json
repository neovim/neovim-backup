            "body": "@MathiasKandelborg, this is how neovim behaves currently:\r\nwith `set autoread`: If a change is detected in the file being displayed in the current buffer, and the buffer has no changes, `:checktime` causes the file to be reloaded without a prompt. However, if the buffer does has some changes, you will see a prompt asking you how to proceed, i.e., overwrite the current file or update.\r\nwith `set noautoread`: If a change is detected in the file being displayed in the current buffer, `:checktime` creates a prompt and asks you how to proceed.\r\n\r\nThis I think should be the default in vim too. The problem with this approach is of course that you would have to execute `:checktime` or `:e` for neovim to check for changes, or else you won't know what happened until you hit `:w`. However things are changing now :)\r\n\r\nAs for checking changed files on suspend/resume, PR #12531 does that. It already has been merged to the codebase, but you would have to use the latest [`0.5.0` release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/) to get it. (Or if you want, you can build it from master ;)\r\n\r\nFor automatically detecting file changes and notifying users about it, we've worked on #12593, and as @teto said, we need feedback on that PR. So if you want to, and you have the time for it, you could try building neovim with that PR, and report any bugs that you come across on that PR itself, or in a new issue.\r\n\r\n**PS:** By default, neovim has `autoread` set.",
