This is not a roadmap; the project roadmap is here: https://neovim.io/roadmap/_\r\n\r\n# What is the plan for 1.0?\r\n\r\nStick to 0.x until the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. we have a full picture of what the RPC API and Lua APIs look like, this means conventions for:\r\n    - function signatures (all RPC functions should have `opts` param and return a `Dict` to ensure ability to augment them without breaking back-compat)\r\n    - naming conventions, `:help dev-api` `:help dev-lua`\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22287\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19624\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/18585\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11311\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19918\r\n2. Remove `vim.opt`/`vim.opt_local`/`vim.opt_global`\r\n3. Redesign the \"remote plugin\" concept: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27949\r\n4. Redesign `--remote` https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/18414\r\n5. `:checkhealth` reports use of deprecated RPC and Lua APIs.\r\n6. `:lua foo.<tab>` completion should not suggest deprecated things. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21660\r\n\r\n# 1.0\r\n\r\nRelease 1.0 when we have fully-specified conventions for RPC API and Lua stdlib.\r\n\r\n- During 0.x, and continuing through 1.x, we will aggressively deprecate interfaces. This means:\r\n    1. they will be listed in `:help deprecated`, and\r\n    2. where possible they will be flagged by `vim.deprecate()`.\r\n- No APIs will be removed from the RPC API during 1.x.\r\n- Deprecated RPC APIs **emit warnings** in some visible place when used.\r\n\r\n# 2.0\r\n\r\n- REMOVE all deprecated things in the 2.0 release. See also `:help api-contract`.\r\n- Create `nvim_xx` functions that alias all `nvim_xx2` functions.\r\n    - Deprecate the existing `nvim_xx2` names.\r\n    - Example: `nvim_exec` will alias `nvim_exec2`. `nvim_exec2` will still exist but will be deprecated, and clients using `nvim_exec2` can easily migrate to `nvim_exec`.",

If it's not the right place to ask or not my place to ask I'd understand and apologize.\r\n\r\nMy question is about how much of a priority are the issues linked there ?\r\n\r\nBecause from a user perspective (2 years very happy user with a heavy 70+ plugins config and occasional contributors of plugins) neovim seems already extremely stable, very capable and with an outsanding plugin ecosystem. The 0.X versionning can hurt the project by slowing down adoption (I really hesitated  making the switch to nvim and many people I know do because of version. 0.X can scream unstable, buggy software to some). There is an very strong network effect for code editors with plugins (73% of devs use VSCode in 2023 (stackoverflow survey) so plugins are made for VScode; and because of plugins more users use VSCode etc.) therefore every day without 1.X has compounding effects beyond just the immediately lost users. And it's in everyone's interest to have a network effect in our favor because plugins are a game changer.\r\n\r\nAnd for example having guidelines to raise errors or a native Promise system (when plenary does an ok job) don't seem required for a 1.0. I understand some people might feel different and 100% respect that but believe transparency about certain decisions might be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your efforts for this outsanding editor",
