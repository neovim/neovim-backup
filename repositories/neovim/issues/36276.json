    "body": "### Problem\n\nCurrently, Neovim's soft wrapping (`wrap` option) is tied to window width rather than text column position. This makes it impossible to view files with consistent 80-column visual wrapping. The actual text area width becomes variable and unpredictable.\n\n<img width=\"1710\" height=\"1107\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc77bc80-8220-4ffc-b55d-a1193fb9d4cd\" />\n\n## Non-Solutions\n\n### Setting window width to 80 columns\n\nFirst, you need to take into account signcolumn and numbers. For me it's 83 width for some files, 82 for others and 84 for longer ones. Second, this may change dynamically as you go from 99 lines to a 100.\n\n### textwidth and formatting commands\n\nThese modify the actual file content, which is unacceptable when viewing external codebases or files I don't want to alter.\n\n###  colorcolumn as visual guide\n\nThat's what I already use. But I want consistency without random line size.\n\n### Zooming in\n\nI do that often. Just zoom, so lines are wrapping. But I have to work with large fonts and I don't like it.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAdd a new option (my name would be: `textwrap`) that enables soft wrapping at a fixed text column, independent of window width and UI elements.\n\n```lua\n-- Proposed usage\nvim.opt.textwrap = 80  -- Soft wrap at 80 text columns\nvim.opt.textwrap = 0   -- Disable (default)\n```\n\n* Lines visually wrap at the specified column in the text area\n* Wrapping occurs at word boundaries when linebreak is enabled\n* The option works independently of textwidth (hard vs soft wrapping)\n\nThis is a known limitation that vim or neovim can't solve. I hope we can do something about that (I can try to find time to contribute, but idk if that is too hard for me)",
