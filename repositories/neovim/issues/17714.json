If you set the `PATH` value to `C:\\WIndows;C:\\Windows\\System32`, the `nvim.exe` you built should have this problem as well as `zip`. Or all libraries are statically linked. Or, all necessary DLLs are in the current directory. In any case, the search order(place) for dlls is as shown in follow document and cannot be different between MSVC and clang.\r\n\r\nRef. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order\r\n\r\nFrom the above document, it seems that the problem occurs because `7. the folder from which the application is loaded.` is a directory with a symbolic link. Therefore, a workaround is to create symbolic links for the necessary DLLs in the directory where the symbolic link was created(In addition, the `VIMRUNTIME` environment variable must be set).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
