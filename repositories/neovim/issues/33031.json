It is both time consuming and inefficient as user might need results from only focused window. So an option to search only focused window will be very helpfull.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nOne possible way to address this issue is by adding a new value to option `hlsearch` which will only search focused window instead of all opened windows.",

When I use `/tree` to search for the string `tree` in left window, it also searches for `tree` in right window and highlights the matching patterns. I want to prevent this behaviour. When I am searching in left window, Neovim should only search for matching patterns in left window, and not in right window. If I need to search the same pattern in right window, I could do this by switching to right window and pressing `n`.\n\nI said that it is **inefficient** because even though I do not need results from right window, it is searching that window. As I actually don't know how this searching mechanism is implemented, I think it is searching the whole buffer opened in right window as well. If the buffer is big enough, it will consume quite a long amount of time for searching.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2527662b-9e94-4924-b804-68c23f7f4c10",
