Based on this issue, I think that the bundle needs to be loaded using the dyld API. For example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54012960\r\n\r\nFull logs: [main.log](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/files/11840801/main.log)\r\nNeovim version: 12c2c16acf7051d364d29cfd71f2542b0943d8e8\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe build uses the standard Release build with disabled USE_BUNDLED (=OFF) option. However, changing this option does not solve this issue. The MacPorts build file for neovim:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/editors/neovim-devel/Portfile\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n12c2c16acf7051d364d29cfd71f2542b0943d8e8\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 13.4\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nkitty 0.28.1\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-kitty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nMacPorts (build from repo / maintainer)",
