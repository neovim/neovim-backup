    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\n\nNo\n\n### Feature description\n\nDuring writing a framework for testing Neovim plugins, I discovered `vim.api.nvim__screenshot()`. Although it seems to be [\"quasi-official\"](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12838#issuecomment-687662042), it served the purpose very well. It can be used for making reference screenshot to be compared later during testing. And bonus points for being directly displayable in terminal (with small tweaks) in case of an error.\r\n\r\nHowever, I recently discovered that it seems to depend heavily on terminal emulator in which it is being used. Although text is the same, ANSI escape codes might differ. So this is not very robust (e.g. doesn't really work straightforwardly inside Github Actions CI).\r\n\r\nI guess, this is a two-part issue:\r\n- Does core team would be interested in making this a \"full officially\" exported function? What should be done to achieve this? I imagine: documentation, tests, and some way of making it exported?\r\n- Is there a way to make it more robust with intent to let plugin authors use it inside tests? I have very limited knowledge about terminal emulators and Neovim codebase, so can't tell if this is a silly question or not.\r\n\r\n@bfredl, as original author, could you, please, share your opinion on this? Thanks.",

It gets (and can assert) UI events. Etc.\r\n\r\nTerminal output is just a _target_ of our core UI. Scraping the terminal output, is a redundant \"roundtrip\", programmatically and conceptually.",
