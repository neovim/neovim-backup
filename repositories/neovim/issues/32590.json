Made a number of probably-flawed changes to try and progress towards that goal.\n\nMy take on this so far:\n\n- If a path is provided through a cmd or lua api (or some other user input), it will be forcefully converted into forward slashes at the point we know to interpret it as a path, as early as reasonably possible\n    - Currently choosing to do so after wildcard resolution for the scenarios it occurs\n- If a path is passed along through the nvim internals, it will be assumed to have forward-slashes, and no action will be taken\n- If a path is loaded from a shada file, it will be forcefully converted to forward slashes on read\n    - All writes moving forward should already be correctly converted\n- When a path is provided to `uv_` anything, it will be forcefully converted to backslashes first\n- When a path is acquired from `uv_` anything, it will be forcefully converted to forward-slashes\n    - These last two bullets mostly apply to the `os_` functions\n\n\nThere's a few hiccups I've run into.\n\n1. vim.uv will not comply with always using `/`, given that its an imported dependency.  Not sure what to do to address that, but so long as uv is exposed directly, there's a risk someone will use it and get backslashes from `uv.cwd`.\n2. `shellslash` implies an additional layer of difficulty - do we need to convert all UI or API exposed paths to `\\` if this is \"off\"?  alternatively, it could be deprecated, or I am simply misunderstanding?\n\nI'm sure those aren't the only problems, but its a work in progress.\nWould love some recommendations or guidance if you think it would be useful.",
