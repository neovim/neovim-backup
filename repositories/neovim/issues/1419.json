If In understand it correctly, this makes it so tabs are expanded a variable amount of spaces in a buffer, so\n\n```\na<tab>b<tab>c<tab>d\n```\n\nwill be displayed as\n\n```\na    b    c    d\n```\n\nfor `vartabstop=4`, and as\n\n```\na    b          c                d\n```\n\nfor `vartabstop=4,10,16,4`. This is similar to some functionality available in word processors, but I'm not sure what is point, since these stops are the same for every tabstop in the buffer (whereas elastic tabpstops depend on the context). It might \"simulate\" elastic stops in combination with `autoindent` and `noexpandtab`, but it certainly is not the same idea, and it looks quite a bit clunkier and uncomfortable.\n",

I don't know what the most idiomatic way of specifying it in Vim might be, but you should be able to do things like specify lines 1-10 have tabstops at positions 4, 14, 30, 34 while lines 11-20 have tabstops at positions 5, 11, 17, 23 for example.\n\nI would love to see my invention find its way to Vim. Until then, one option for people who want a vi like editor with elastic tabstops is to use [Textadept](http://foicica.com/textadept/) with scripts to implement [vi key bindings](https://github.com/jugglerchris/textadept-vi) and [elastic tabstops](http://foicica.com/wiki/elastic-tabstops). This is possible because Textadept uses the brilliant cross-platform [Scintilla text widget](http://www.scintilla.org/) which [I added the ability to set non-uniform tabstops to](http://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/code/ci/3f3ae214c626d7276aee35a14d1ffa1ad848c9cd/). You can see how its API works [here](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_CLEARTABSTOPS):\n\n> SCI_CLEARTABSTOPS(int line)\n> SCI_ADDTABSTOP(int line, int x)\n> SCI_GETNEXTTABSTOP(int line, int x)\n> SCI_CLEARTABSTOPS clears explicit tabstops on a line. SCI_ADDTABSTOP adds an explicit tabstop at the specified distance from the left (in pixels), and SCI_GETNEXTTABSTOP gets the next explicit tabstop position set after the given x position, or zero if there aren't any.\n\nYou can see my native implementation of elastic tabstops for Scintilla (which uses this API) [here](https://github.com/nickgravgaard/ElasticTabstopsForScintilla).\n\nI hope this gives someone some ideas :)\n",

            "body": "@BatmanAoD Sadly you are correct. As I said back in 2015 (earlier on this page), it looks like the `vartabs` feature lets one set non-uniform tabstops, but they are the same for all lines. That's not enough to implement elastic tabstops.\r\n\r\nWe either need a dedicated elastic tabstops mode, or the ability to implement elastic tabstops by allowing a script to set non-uniform tabstop positions differently for different lines as the user edits the text in the buffer. If the `vartabs` functionality can be used by a script to change tabstop positions as the user edits the text in the buffer we are half way there. I assume this is the case - can anyone confirm this is possible? If so we just need `vartabs` to take an extra parameter specifying the line number range.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, currently `vartabs` takes a list of tabstop sizes (eg 4, 20, 10, 8). We need to add another parameter to this so we can specify the line number range (eg. lines 7 to 13) the tabstop sizes apply to. Maybe that could be optional so if the line range parameter is missing it's applied to all lines.\r\n\r\nIn this `vartabs` feature one sets it like [this](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/04958cbaf25eea27eceedaa987adfb354ad5f7fd#diff-9314fb84f930a1648810c882e8247e6fR8510):\r\n```:set vartabstop=4,20,10,8```\r\nWhat should this look like if it took (optional?) start and end line numbers? Is it possible to do something like this?\r\n```:set vartabstop=[4,20,10,8],7,13```",

Anyway, I'd like to offer a proposal for a shitty hack to pass the time, which you should take as quasi-para-satircal (along with this horrible affix construction), because it's only intended to pass time, i.e. not necessarily something to take serious— like a toy model, not like a joke, but please do see the humour in it: use a file preprocessor/parser, a keylogger, a screen scanner, and a keyboard hook. At this rate it'd probably go faster to automate the feature into existence that way than to get this implemented directly, but please do avoid getting me wrong here, I mean this with respect to the complexity of the feature 🆚 the complexity of the vim codebase. I don't even use vim at the moment (which probably means that I likely messed up the syntax of the joke at the start), I just observe this issue out of great academic interest, so I have no stake here & simply wait for the puzzle pieces to slowly assemble.
