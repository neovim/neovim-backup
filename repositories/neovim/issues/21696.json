I don't think the behaviour is exactly quadratic, but the number of times this loop is run does not increase linearly. `ml_find_line_or_offset` is called by [`extmark_splice`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/24b60b0f71e0ffbd09c827230ecb5a37e833cade/src/nvim/extmark.c#L585) and `extmark_splice` is called on every edit. I was thinking I could add a struct parameter to `ml_find_or_offset` and store the values computed in the loop so that subsequent calls to that function do not have to recompute from the start, but It would require threading that parameter through `extmark_splice` and `do_sub` and I'm not sure of the ergonomics.",
