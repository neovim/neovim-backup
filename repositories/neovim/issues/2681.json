    "body": "The definition of the `foreground()` function is empty (eval.c):\n\n``` c\nstatic void f_foreground(typval_T *argvars, typval_T *rettv)\n{\n}\n```\n\nAlthough the function is not useful for the default UI on Unix because it is not linked to X11 libraries and, thus, cannot raise the terminal window, it is useful for graphical user interfaces, like [neovim-qt](https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt). Perhaps, the function should send a message to the UI which then would decide what to do.\n\nI think that the default UI on Unix should do nothing. Another option is to work with a provider, like it is done with the clipboard. For example, `wmctrl` could be the provider for `foreground()` because on Linux we can raise a terminal emulator window with the command:\n\n```\nwmctrl -ia $WINDOWID\n```\n",
