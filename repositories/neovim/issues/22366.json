Redirecting to sth like `vim.api.nvim_err_writeln` would help. It could also explain how to 'raise' Lua errors from low-level core functions, that are later transformed to friendly errors.\r\n\r\nOr ``I want to expose map-able actions (not necessarily with config in a `setup` function)``, talk about actions in different modes, actions that return an expr, why / when to choose which..\r\n(And I'm sure there are many others)",
