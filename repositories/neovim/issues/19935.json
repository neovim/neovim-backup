Currently, the only \"official\"/\"reliable\" way to get between basic modes is to use the default keybindings. If you want to do something else, too bad (though I'm sure there are exceptions/workarounds that I can't find via Google).\r\n\r\nFairly simple in concept, though I'm not sure how ingrained the default keybindings are in (neo)vim to their actual function of changing modes.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\nIn telescope prompt, I want a dual behavior of `<Esc>`: close the window if the prompt is empty, otherwise change to normal mode. However, now that I've overridden the escape key functionality, there's not way to get back into normal mode. Having a `nvim_set_mode` function would easily solve the issue, while also providing some extra flexibility",

Right now a lot of behavior can only be accessed through a brittle interface that:\r\n- assumes user hasn't remapped the hotkey in question\r\n- makes scripts less readable (\"J\" vs. join_lines())\r\n- has no way to retrieve the original behavior if that mapping is replaced (and not all default hotkeys even can be redefined, I suspect partly because of this problem)\r\n\r\nI can't think of any other program that calls an API by sending raw keyboard input, like some kind of super-`eval`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding API functions doesn't subtract anything and the existing hotkeys can instead be defined in terms of them. You have already committed to an interface contract by including these mappings in the first place, this just gives them stable aliases in the function namespace.",
