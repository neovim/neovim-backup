    "body": "### Problem\n\n`'completeopt'` without `noinsert` can be way too intrusive as you can't easily add characters to the completion prefix. But `'completeopt'` with `noinsert` is also not optimal as it actually inserts text into the buffer when an item except the first one is selected. Moreover, `noinsert` makes it harder to preview the result of picking the first completion item without inserting it unless you do something like `<C-n><C-p>`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt is possible to leverage virtual text for this. We can either:\r\n- Show virtual text for `noinsert` instead of inserting the text. OR,\r\n- Add a `virttext` flag (tentatively named) to `completeopt`, which will show the selected item using virtual text.",
