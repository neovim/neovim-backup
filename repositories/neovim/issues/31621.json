            "body": "Pretty sure loading a file browser plugin late breaks opening a directory from the command line (e.g., `nvim .`, I believe the buffers are created before plugins are loaded, and plugins like netrw/oil therefore have to check existing buffers on `VimEnter`) so it's not something most people are likely to do. And even if that wasn't an issue, I think `filetype` is the wrong place to solve that anyway. If we wanted to improve directory handling in Neovim I would seriously suggest a new autocommand event type be added.\n\nWhile this suggestion was already met with 'this would have to go through Vim' I'm not entirely convinced that's true? Neovim has a number of bespoke autocommand events not present in Vim, such as the channel and UI events, but I believe there's also some cursor and mode related ones?",
