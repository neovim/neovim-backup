            "body": "I think there are a couple things causing this... first of all it seems like writing to `Neovim.logger` from a remote plugin breaks the rpc connection. Try removing those lines that write to the logger.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you're going to run into though, is that you're calling `ui_attach` on the remote plugin DSL object, not a neovim client. I think this closer to what you want, although I'm not sure if this works either:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nNeovim.plugin do |plug|\r\n  plug.command(:StartMyUI) do |client|\r\n    client.ui_attach(999, 999, {})\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not sure if you want to spawn a UI within a remote plugin like this... I'm pretty unfamiliar with writing UI clients but my understanding was that the UI process should be responsible for starting an embedded nvim process, which it sends the `nvim_ui_attach` rpc when it's ready to draw (see docs: https://neovim.io/doc/user/ui.html). Maybe @justinmk could point to better resources/examples? Sorry I'm not super helpful here.",
