For `v:event` to be populated with visual mode and visual boundaries (row and col).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, for there to be a `visual_change` ui event with the same information.\r\n\r\nThe information (mode and boundaries) is not strictly required, as it can be obtained by `mode()`, `getpos('v')`, and `getpos('.')`. However, getting it directly would be better. The most important thing is to be notified when the selection changes.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nI am the current maintainer of https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim.\r\n\r\nCurrently, visual selection is not properly managed. Instead of telling vscode exactly where the visual selection is (so that vscode can render it, use it for commands, show it in minimap, etc), we render it ourselves using the `Visual` highlight. This is suboptimal.\r\n\r\nTo properly sync visual selection to vscode, we need to know when the visual selection changes in neovim. We can't use the `Visual` highlight, because it only gives updates for ranges inside the viewport. We can't use `CursorMoved`, because the visual selection can change without the cursor moving (`viw`).\r\n\r\nThis is a duplicate of https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11590. \r\n",
