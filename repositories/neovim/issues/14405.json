            "body": "Hello there. I thought I'd add to this conversation. At least at the surface, I seem to be experiencing the same issue as described here, but in a different manner. \n\nI usually launch Neovim by doing `Ctrl+L` in Explorer and writing `nvim <relativefilename>`. When resizing a NeoVim window, everything works perfectly fine, but if I maximize the NVim window and then minimize it, weird things start to happen.\n\nFirst, the interface looks very weird:\n<img width=\"960\" height=\"492\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dca6198-90d0-4b5b-86c1-bad3ef69d1c5\" />\n\n<details><summary>(here how it's supposed to look if you're wondering for some reason)</summary>\n<p>\n\n<img width=\"959\" height=\"462\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42924280-7818-4fc2-b2b6-4ae73d4e2595\" />\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\nBut if I try resizing the window in any way after that (including maximizing), then these ugly scrollbars appear and they're the worst. Sometimes the horizontal bar blocks the command line completely unless you fiddle around with the size.\n<img width=\"1017\" height=\"519\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1839530-c994-4b6f-b5c8-4a261f391eb6\" />\n\nI like working with Vim while maximized/fullscreen and you're always one mistype/misclick away from having to completely restart Vim, so I've been desperately trying to find a solution, which is how I've found this issue. I know it's a very old one, but the issue is still present on the latest stable release. I'll be more than happy to help.\n\nI'm open to answering any other questions, but for starters some of my specs are:\n```\nWindows 10 - 1909 (Build 18363.657)\nStandard Windows Command Prompt [Version 10.0.18363.657]\nJust incase, installed the freshest stable NVim release off of the official source, issue persists\n```\n\nI think there are some useful directions I could take this, I have access to a bunch of different computers I could test this on with interesting spec variations, though I'm not able to do it all today. I'm open to whatever communications and have subscribed to the issue.",

I assume that for you `CTRL+L` in the file explorer opens some terminal, but for me, it just opens the filepath bar with a drop down of filepath suggestions.\n\nIt seems to me this is an issue with the terminal emulator/shell you are opening nvim with. But I can't tell what it is from the image as it doesn't look like anything on my machine. I use Windows terminal but with powershell, and I don't have this issue.\n\nEdit: Actually, maybe this is a Windows 10 issue as all my computers I regularly use are Windows 11. I might dust off my laptop later and test this on Windows 10. Granted, I don't remember having this issue prior to upgrading to Windows 11 either.",

            "body": "@crwebb85 Okay, I did some experimenting and found something very interesting out. For starters, I'll respond to Your most recent comment.\n\n### Response\n\nNo, `Ctrl + L` doesn't open any terminal; otherwise, I would've mentioned it. Yes, it opens the \"filepath bar\", but that's the whole point: it's not just some bloatware bar for full filepaths. You could think of it like a mini-command bar. You could do `ping example.com`; `cmd`, which opens the command prompt in the directory You're at in Explorer; You could navigate directories by typing their names, open files and binaries and etc. ...\n\nI don't know, maybe it's just a power user thing, but for a clear example, say there's this filetree:\n- files\n  - code\n    - main.c\n\nI could navigate to `files\\` (either by mouse, keyboard or the aforementioned command line), and do `nvim code\\main.c` in the command line to open `main.c` in Vim with root `files\\`. It'll open a command prompt terminal delegated by Windows specifically for Vim. And there comes in the catch I found out.\n\n### Findings\n\nThrough some experimentation, I may have just found out how to replicate this issue.\n\nSay, You've got a `cmd` window, already open, right? That's the usual way I see everybody here uses Vim. If You open NVim by doing `nvim` there, it works perfectly fine! The problem actually goes away!\n\n<img width=\"618\" height=\"200\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf75878-236e-4cb3-90ef-3f4a14ff4274\" />\n\n<img width=\"318\" height=\"327\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/054a7d58-360d-47f9-93a9-48d30273168d\" />\n<img width=\"480\" height=\"248\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f81f354-1de1-4715-a327-706c2143a8a4\" />\n\nBut, when I work, this is super inconvenient for a thousand and one reason. So instead, I open NVim with the \"Run\" menu (`Super + R` if someone doesn't know that either somehow) or with the Explorer command line again. As said in the reply, that will open a terminal delegated specifically for Vim (which is one of the reasons), You can tell because an NVim instance launched from `cmd` will retain the `cmd` logo and group in with any other command prompts you may have open, while a separate NVim window will get its icon and will have a separate group for NVim instances:\n\n<img width=\"161\" height=\"163\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a491c9fe-4e1e-4ef8-ba23-73bba900eb2c\" />\n\nWell, here's the thing, for some reason, the \"cool\" NVim, that was lauched independently, is the one that has this bug! So here's the theorem:\n_Launching NVim independently highlights the problem, while launching with a terminal already as a parent omits it._\n\nWhat I want right now is for some of You to test out, whether the problem appears if you launch NVim using these steps:\n1. Press `Windows + R`\n2. Type `nvim`\nThis should open NVim independently. If the issue can be replicated on Your machines, great! If not, the bug is a bit more sophisticated, but I still have ideas. I'll be ready to hear back from You.\n\nSome guesses as to what's happening is that when NVim \"creates\" its own window, it may come with unfavourable settings, that are otherwise set in instantiated terminals, but I'm not sure. Opening other terminal programs \"independently\" does not seem to replicate the same bug.\n\n### ==============================================================\n\nAnyways, hope You're having an awesome day, nice to see some progress. Peace!",

Actually, the whole computer is pretty fresh. Welp, once I got access to it, I checked out the 2 ways to open NVim I talked about before, and none of them had the bug.\n\nNow that's interesting, and I'm wondering where to take this next. I still have a bunch of computers to test out on left with different specs, so we'll see how it exactly pans out, I'll test it out when I get access to them.\n\nAgain, I'm requesting for someone to test out the bug on their own machine, try to replicate it with the two methods, but also for someone to read this, and third, I want to talk with someone who's pretty knowledgeable at NVim, maybe that'll help figure some stuff out.\n\nMaybe there's some NVim option that could break the intended behaviour or there's something, etc.\n\nI've done some more observations, but they didn't yield any results. One of them, for example, was comparing the window settings of a separate NVim terminal and of a parent-instantiated NVim terminal. Obviously, there were some differences, but none stood out to seem to be the cause of the issue.\n\nAnyways, have a nice day, thanks for reading and replying in advance. Imma go.",
