To fix this I need to get the length of the last line in buffer, but I can't do that since the function is only called after the deletion happened. So it's difficult to fix without changing that behavior.\n2. After working on this a bit, I am somewhat convinced that those positions are fine\n  - Position being out of bound is fine, as  this happens every time when the last line is deleted\n  - They result in the same state, because using `dd` on a single line is basically deleting the line first and then inserting a new line, which is what the parameters are trying to say.\n\n",

And I assume the new line being \"inserted\" would be empty, so shouldn't we expect the new end position to be the same as the start position?",
