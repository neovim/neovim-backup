I've found it useful in certain applications to color code nested folds to better track their hierarchy. To do so one would need to define highlight groups based on the [level of fold](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/fbe18d9ca41a419414cb112d0a426aa8803c6236/src/nvim/fold.h#L17), e.g. `Folded1`, `Folded2`, etc. (or some better naming scheme).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on this, but totally new to the neovim codebase. Please let me know if folks like this idea and/or think this is feasible.",
