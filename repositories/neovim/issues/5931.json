Am I right in understanding you would be ok with another behavior ? In fact I finally found a behavior I am comfortable with, ie., on the last column, just do as in all other editors  and put fold open/closed on the same line. Here is a preview with a max nesting of 3.\r\n\r\nWith enough fdc, there are no problems:\r\n![2017-01-27-214323_956x487_scrot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/886074/22387043/1d580326-e4da-11e6-9f10-4c964b6b107c.png)\r\n\r\nBut when the number of columns is not enough to display each fold on its own column, nvim merges all the folds with a level >= fdc on the same column; example with fdc=2:\r\n![2017-01-27-214315_956x487_scrot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/886074/22387041/1953a24e-e4da-11e6-90fa-b690389ee7ba.png)\r\n\r\n...and fdc=1:\r\n![2017-01-27-214307_956x487_scrot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/886074/22387031/1323b86e-e4da-11e6-896b-f37cef726db2.png)\r\n\r\nIf you are ok with it I can proceed with cleaning the code and writing tests.\r\n",
