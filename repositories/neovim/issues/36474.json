Presumably the same for `on_lines`, etc?\n\nThe tricky part is deciding what to send in this case. Vim/Nvim is currently not smart enough to diff the buffer on an external change, based on how undo (`u`) works after reloading via `:checktime` or `:edit`. But it really should...\n\nMeanwhile, until that is resolved, I suppose the correct thing to do here is to send the entire buffer contents as a buffer-update. Probably just a missing `..._splice` call somewhere.",
