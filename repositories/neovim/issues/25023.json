    "body": "### Problem\n\nCurrently, the end of buffer fillchar only shows after the last editable line. This means that in an empty buffer, the \"first line\" is shown as line 1 instead of the `~` char, which feels somewhat unintuitive. It doesn't seem like there's a straightforward way to write a plugin to alter this behavior either, as from what I can tell text can't be placed into the number column and and virtual text can only be placed in the buffer area.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be cool if there was a way to alter the current behavior to not have to rely solely on the \"--No lines in buffer--\" message to tell if a line is actually empty. For instance, I really like how helix (on the right) shows the empty line.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"909\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/56745535/518fb5a6-345d-4e41-82a9-229eb64fcef1\">\r\n\r\nI think an ideal solution would be to allow text to be shown in the number column, so that we can just check if the first line is empty or not and show the eob char there. It would finally also be possible to consistently align the character in the same column as the line numbers, though I realize that's just a matter of personal preference.\r\n\r\nThat being said, from what I've read (https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8ee4c01b8c79a29065c1af05e5d9c0721069765f), it doesn't seem like any of the columns extend past the end of a buffer anymore, so I'm not sure how simple this will be.\r\n\r\nI do realize that this is somewhat of a low priority, purely aesthetic issue. I just wanted to offer my thoughts on this, since I've always thought it was a bit weird how (n)vim handled this situation. Thanks for your time!",
