    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe `peer` option was introduced to `serverlist()` as a fix for this issue: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21600\n\nCurrently, this just runs `find` in the `stdpath('run')` directory of the calling neovim's server. This misses neovim sockets which are run with custom run directory. For instance, when running neovim with this command: \n\n```\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR=~/Downloads/ nvim\n```\n\n`serverlist({peer = true})` doesn't actually list that instance of neovim.\n\n`serverlist({peer = true})` was added in this PR: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34806\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun neovim with\n\n```\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR=~/Downloads/ nvim\n```\n\nThen in another terminal run neovim again (without the specific runtime dir) and call `:echo serverlist({ \"peer\" = 1})`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`serverlist({ peer = true })` also lists the neovim run with the Download runtime directory.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-1034+gf363ea8547\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, `serverlist` is different for Vim.\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nPop!_OS 22.04 LTS x86_64\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20240203-110809-5046fc22\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",

I tested it, it certainly finds more servers than without that change.\n\nChanging `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=~/Downloads/` is a different topic, we don't need to solve that now.\n\nHere's how to repro the issue I reported:\n\n1. start two or more `nvim` instances\n2. Look carefully at `stdpath('run')` in both of them. Their run-dirs are formatted like `<tmpdir>/<user>/<random>/`.\n\nThe current `peer=true` logic needs to go up just one parent dir to find all servers in the `<tmpdir>/<user>/` \"root dir\".",
