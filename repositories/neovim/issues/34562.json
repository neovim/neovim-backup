Maybe re-framing the design to only have user-customizable spinner shape (as a global list option, for example) and delegating everything else spinner-related to implementations?",

            "body": "> it will \"just work\" every time statusline is refreshed, but will look random because the \"refresh rate\" of 'statusline' is not fixed.\n\nI have the impression that this is a bit the elephant of the room that needs discussion.\n\nThere can be different triggers for statusline updates (E.g. there are examples like `autocmd LspProgress * redrawstatus` in the docs.)\n\nThe problem is that with each additional trigger, the refresh rate increases. Which would make a spinner go faster. But worse - for cases like consuming progress messages, it will cycle through them more quickly, making it more difficult to read them before they disappear.\n\nOne way to deal with that could be to:\n\n- Ensure the statusline is redrawn at least with a given rate (and additional triggers get smoothed out somehow?)\n- Have a function/component that allows to adjust the updates bases on the current refresh rate, to have it decoupled from ^ similar to how in games one no longer moves faster just because you have more FPS. This could be decoupled from a spinner and applicable to any kind of queue-of-things which one might want to consume at a given rate. Like progress messages\n",

            "body": "## Define 3 Layers\n\n- **Spinner Layer**: Displays spinner characters.\n- **Driver Layer**: The driver that starts/stops/refreshes the spinner, such as `LspProgress`, asynchronous tasks like `vim.system()`, etc.\n- **UI Layer**: The place where the spinner is displayed, such as `statusline`, `tabline`, etc.\n\n## Who Drives Next Frame: Spinner or Driver?\n\nFrom the perspective of the UI layer, a spinner frame is just a **read-only** character.\n\n1. If driven by the **Driver**, we need to consider the frequency/frame rate of the Driver:\n   a. Some drivers do not have progress capabilities and only have start/stop events, such as `one-shot` jobs.\n   b. The progress of a **Driver** is random, so a compatibility layer is needed to wrap it for stable spinner display.\n    ```lua\n    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"LspProgress\", {\n     callback = function()\n         -- get next frame\n         local ch = vim.iter.cycle(chars)\n     end,\n    })\n    ```\n    **Drivers** like `LspProgress` have progress notification capabilities and can drive the next frame by subscribing to `LspProgress`, but one-shot asynchronous tasks do not.\n2. If the **Spinner** itself drives the next frame, the **Spinner** only needs to provide `start()` + `stop()` APIs.\n   This offers higher scalability and allows spinners to be displayed for all asynchronous tasks.\n   For example:\n   a. call `spinner:start()` when initiating requests like `lsp_diagnostic` or `lsp_goto_definition`,\n   b. call `spinner:stop()` after job done.\n\n**Conclusion**\nHaving the **Spinner** drive the next frame itself provides better encapsulation, clearer semantics, and stronger scalability.\n\n## Who Refreshes the UI: Spinner or Driver?\n\nSpinners can be displayed in the following locations, each with different refresh methods and **none** refresh automatically:\n\n| UI           | show                                     | refresh                              |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| statusline   | `set statusline=\"%!v:lua.spinner()\"`     | `:redrawstatus` or `nvim__redraw()`  |\n| tabline      | `set tabline=\"%!v:lua.spinner()\"`        | `:redrawtabline` or `nvim__redraw()` |\n| statuscolumn | `set statuscolumn=..`                    | `redraw` or `nvim__redraw()`         |\n| extmarks     | `nvim_buf_set_extmark()`                 | `nvim_buf_set_extmark()`             |\n| floatwindow  | `nvim_open_win() + nvim_buf_set_lines()` | `nvim_buf_set_lines()`               |\n\nDisplaying spinners in UIS requires some configuration code.\n\nIf the **Driver** refreshes the **UI**, we facing the same issues of frequency/frame rate and who drives the next frame.\nSince frame rate/frequency information is encapsulated within the **Spinner**, the Spinner should be responsible for refreshing the UI.\n\nFor example, `spinner:start()` can accept a callback `on_step` executed when when the spinner drives the next frame, then updates the **UI**.\n\n```lua\nlocal sp = vim.ui.spinner()\nlocal on_step = function()\n    vim.cmd(\"redrawstatus\") -- refresh statusline\nend\nsp:start(on_step)\n```\n\n## Is the Frame Rate of the Spinner Fixed?\n\nI prefer Yes.\n\n1. A **Spinner** is just a simple presence/absence indicator; the speed of its refresh has little significance.\n   As mentioned above, perform a spinner with \"slow start, quick end\" —-- than can be done and looks nice, but it’s probably unnecessary.\n2. In general, a Driver's progress events are triggered randomly with no fixed frequency.\n   Therefore, we need to apply `debounce/throttle` to events for smooth refreshing.\n   Refreshing too fast consumes resources (UI refresh is time-consuming after all), while refreshing too slow is meaningless or even causes lag.\n\n## Is a Generator vim.iter.cycle() Needed?\n\n`vim.iter.cycle()` is optional; it does not block the implementation of `vim.ui.spinner()`.\n\nCombining our conclusions:\n\n1. The **Spinner** drives the next frame.\n2. The **Spinner** has a fixed refresh frequency.\n3. The **Spinner** refresh UIs.\n   It’s easy to see that we can implement this using `vim.uv.timer`:\n\n```lua\nlocal chars = { \"⠋\", \"⠙\", \"⠹\", \"⠸\", \"⠼\", \"⠴\", \"⠦\", \"⠧\", \"⠇\", \"⠏\" }\ntimer:start(0, interval, function()\n    local frame = vim.iter.cycle(chars)\nend)\n-- or without vim.iter.cycle()\nlocal idx = 0\nlocal chars = {...}\ntimer:start(0, interval, function()\n    idx = (idx % #chars) + 1\n    local frame = chars[idx]\nend)\n```\n\n## Proposal\n\n```lua\n---@class vim.ui.spinner\n---@field start fun(self: vim.ui.spinner, on_step?: function) start spinner\n---@field stop fun(self: vim.ui.spinner) stop spinner\n---@field __tostring fun(self: vim.ui.spinner): string\n---\n---@class vim.ui.spinner.Opts\n---@field chars? string[] spinner chars.\n---@field interval? integer refresh interval, milliseconds.\n---@field ttl? integer the spinner will automatically stop after {ttl} milliseconds.\n\n---Create a spinner.\n---\n---@param opts?: vim.ui.spinner.Opts\n---@return vim.ui.spinner\nvim.ui.spinner = function(opts) end\n```\n\nA example show how to add lsp progress spinner to statusline:\n\n```lua\n--- Not a very good practice, just for demonstration purposes.\nlocal lsp_sp = vim.ui.spinner()\nfunction lsp_sp_component()\n\treturn tostring(lsp_sp)\nend\nvim.o.statusline = vim.o.statusline .. \"%!v:lua.lsp_sp_component()\"\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"LspProgress\", {\n\tcallback = function(event)\n\t\tlocal kind = event.data.params.value.kind\n\t\tif kind == \"begin\" then\n\t\t\tlsp_sp:start(function()\n\t\t\t\tvim.cmd(\"redrawstatus\")\n\t\t\tend)\n\t\tend\n\t\tif kind == \"end\" then\n\t\t\tlsp_sp:stop()\n\t\t\tvim.cmd(\"redrawstatus\")\n\t\tend\n\tend,\n})\n```\n\n## Open Question\n\nShould we encapsulate implementations for several commonly used spinner UIs ? For example, a `CursorSpinner`, which would allow displaying a spinner near the cursor during various LSP operations like `lsp_diagnostic` or `lsp_goto_definition` (I really want to do this).\n\nI created a simple proof-of-concept project: [https://github.com/xieyonn/spinner.nvim](https://github.com/xieyonn/spinner.nvim)\nHere's a preview of a slightly more complex example showing a spinner next to the cursor\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf01d5b-cee1-493d-be4b-fddd6822e461)",
