    "body": "[parinfer](http://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/) is a method for editing lisp.\r\n\r\nIn the example \"Insert or delete a line without rearranging parens:\", there is a part where closing parens are closed. This then triggers an automatic re-balance.\r\n\r\nIn vim, with `set fdm=syntax`, the way this reacts with regards to folding is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(ns example.core\r\n  (:require\r\n    [clojure.string :refer [join]]\r\n    [clojure.data :refer [diff]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen doing `dd` leaves the parens unbalanced\r\n\r\n```\r\n(ns example.core\r\n  (:require\r\n    [clojure.string :refer [join]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes folding to start searching for that closing paren, and in the process will open all of the current folds too. On a large file (I observed this on a 1.3k loc file) this search takes a noticable time. Then [nvim-parinfer.js](https://github.com/clojure-vim/nvim-parinfer.js) reacts to the `TextChanged` event, and re-balances, also triggering a re-fold (less time, but still noticeable).\r\n\r\nSome possible solutions come to mind:\r\n\r\n1. `TextChangedPre` event which runs before fold updates, which would allow nvim-parinfer to do `set fdm=manual`, before restoring the value in `TextChanged`\r\n2. https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold does speed up this case, so is a workaround\r\n3. Trigger re-folding in some kind of `TextChangedPost` event, or generally after the TextChanged auto command has taken place (this seems like a potentially breaking change for anything that searches for those folds)\r\n\r\nThere may be other/better approaches.",
