I tested this in normal, insert, and terminal mode and they all behave the same. Instead it behaves with the default behavior for `<C-h>` keymap which is equavalent to pressing `<BS>`.\n\nI believe I narrowed the bug down to the two week period between commits d825e5116981da249720a4a5f18f11939d8d00fd (broken) and 671841673e7b66f4f40a49a000a6a46e662f802e (works). Unfortunately, I can't git bisect further because I have only successfully been able to build on windows using the zig build. The working commit I found was the most recent version I had in my downloads folder that was working.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nusing the minimal.lua \n```lua\nvim.keymap.set({ \"n\", \"t\", \"i\" }, \"<c-h>\", function()\n\tvim.print(\"Successfully remapped <c-h>\")\nend)\n```\n\n1. run `nvim --clean -u minimal.lua`\n2. Type the keymap `<c-h>`  in normal mode\n3. (optional) type the keymap `<c-h>` in terminal mode and insert mode as well\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nObserve that the message `Successfully remapped <c-h>` does not print like it should and that neovim incorrectly behaves  with the default behavior for `<C-h>` keymap .\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-1676+g1c12073db6\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, 9.0.1642\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro Version 10.0.26100 Build 26100\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nPowerShell 7.5.4\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nGithub release page",

            "body": "I've been investigating a secondary bug and I've decided that it has to be related to this bug so Im going to document it here instead of a new issue. Unfortunately, I have only been able to replicate this secondary issue while using the `which-key` plugin.\n\nProblem: When executing the keymap `<C-w>h`, an issue can occur if the `CTRL` key is unpressed too slowly. If the `CTRL` key is still being pressed when the `h` key is pressed the key map will be interpreted as `<C-w><C-h>` which because of the main bug in this issue will be interpreted as  `<C-w><BS>`. Since `<BS>` causes which-key to remove the last key pressed in a keymap chord the `<C-w>` is removed from the chord and you are back in a state where no keys have been pressed for the current chord. Without which-key, the keymap somehow works correctly and properly moves the cursor to the left window.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Created a `not_quite_minimal_enough.lua` file with the contents \n```lua\nvim.pack.add({ \"https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim.git\" })\nrequire(\"which-key\").setup({})\nvim.schedule(function()\n\tvim.cmd([[ vsplit | wincmd l ]])\nend)\n```\n2. Set environment variable `$NVIM_APPNAME = \"debug_C-W-H_bug\"`\n3. run `nvim .\\not_quite_minimal_enough.lua -u .\\not_quite_minimal_enough.lua`\n4. Press and hold the `CTRL` key\n5. Press the and unpress the `w` key\n6. Press the `h` key\n7. Unpress the `CTRL` and `h` keys\n\nExpected result:\nIf the bug happened then the which-key window should be displayed but the displayed keys should not be the keys that follow `<C-w>`\nIf the bug didn't happen the the expect result is that the cursor should have moved to the left window and the which-key window should be closed.\n\nOther Notes:\nThis secondary issues started happening during the same commit range as this main issue (between commits d825e51 (broken) and 6718416 (works)).
