    "body": "### Problem\n\nCurrently, one of the barrier to keyboard-centric editor like Vim/Neovim is that there are too many keymappings to remember. And this is just worse when plugins also introduce their own mappings. \n\nBoth Emacs and Helix has something like [which-key.nvim](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) built-in. I don't know since when has Helix implemented it, but this is [the commit that added the package to Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/fa4203300fde6820a017bf1089652fb95759d68c#diff-21241810a84cc186b99d148f58af8e3725198fd1bdad73a9ed5c44bb93b52e88R264). \n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen users type a key, a floating window (like `which-key.nvim`) or a popup menu (like Helix) open to show users key bindings that start with the key(s) users have typed. \n\n#### How does it solve the problem?\n\nThis reduces the burden of having to remember too many keymaps, while also helping users remember them and use the keyboard more effectively. Also, it will make Neovim friendlier to beginners\n\nAn alternative would be just installing a plugin. But many people don't even know such plugins exist, or how they look like. \n\n#### Is it worth the cost?\n\nI believe so. As long as Neovim and keyboard-centric modal editing exists, the problem would still exists, and the plugin would always be valuable. \n\n",

For example, I want to delete a paragraph, but I can't remember the exact keymap for paragraph text object. Both `:map da` and `:map a` don't work. But if I use `which-key.nvim`, it can show me that the keybindings for `a paragraph` is `ap`. \n\nI think of `which-key.nvim` like cmdline-completion. Assume that `cmdline-autocompletion` doesn't work, I can still use `command` to search for the user command (yes, similar to `map`, `command` doesn't work with built-in command), for example `command Co`. The trick works, but it's so inconvenient compared to `<Tab>` completion. Not to say I think many people don't know these tricks. I didn't know that I can use `:map` to look for user keymaps until you told me (though I have used Neovim for a year and have written a few plugins), I thought it was to create new new keymappings only. \n\n> It is not a project goal to provide every feature out of the box\n\nI know that, and I agree with that.
