    "body": "- nvim 0.3.1\r\n- all terminals and operating systems.\r\n\r\nSince I upgraded to Neovim 0.3.1 I notice NERDTree cursorline looks broken with my preferred Vim theme of [moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors).\r\n\r\nSome Googling indicates others have the same experience as noted in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/91b7mg/broken_cursorline_highlighting_nvim/) and following image.\r\n\r\n![9g9lht08nrb11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11382509/45794665-ee32d000-bcda-11e8-850d-979c5731cffe.png)\r\n\r\nNotice the `CursorLine` in the NERDTree window, it does not stretch across the full width of the window, it only highlights the section after the `zsh` extension.\r\n\r\nI get the same result with my theme.\r\n\r\nI think this relates to Neovim changes to CursorLine priority; especially if one only sets a `ctermbg` color without setting a foreground color. Reading through some of the Neovim CursorLine priority discussions it is mentioned that if one sets foreground and background then the priority system will not come it play. That is correct from my quick testing.\r\n\r\nHowever, in my case I do not want to set a foreground color for the `CursorLine`, I only set a low contrast background color whilst preserving the existing colors of the current line. Setting a CursorLine foreground color results in the loss of coloring for the current selected line (aka it looks ugly with my theme).\r\n\r\nHow can I bypass Neovim CursorLine priority changes (for 0.3.1 and above) whilst only setting the background color?\r\n\r\nNote, Vim 8.1 renders the NERDTree current line correctly via `CursorLine` if background is the only color set. Same went for Neovim 0.3.0 and earlier.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

Setting the foreground color for the appropriate NERDTree highlight group works perfectly.\r\n\r\nNote, the [vim-one](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one) theme has the same breakage as noted in the original post of this request. I suspect quite a few Vim themes are broken. However, the solution is simple as noted just above.\r\n\r\nI don't require any changes to Neovim.

Unfortunately, since CursorLine previously had a higher priority in vim, so syntax author often linked a color back to Normal to \"reset\" the color, and thus they broke after that pull request.\r\n\r\nThe simple workaround if you are not using bg color is to clear it using `hi Normal ctermbg=NONE`.  A better way to fix this is to add a very special cases to make CursorLine override Normal in neovim. My guess is that this is not easy.  I will check if that is feasible when I have time.\r\n\r\n> Any way to set CursorLine background's priority higher than other groups?\r\n\r\nSorry, no.  Vim's highlight priority is coded by thousands of lines of code rather than a number.",

The `white` color applies to `cterm` when in gui and `gui` when in `cterm`.\r\n> \r\n> It's totally white for me as well and still doesn't work as expected.\r\n\r\nThis might be because @zfzackfrost's solution doesn't correctly check for\r\ntermguicolors or running in a GUI. Here is a version that I've tested using\r\nterminal Neovim and Goneovim:\r\n\r\n```vim\r\nfunction! s:CustomizeColors()\r\n    if has('gui_running') || &termguicolors || exists('g:gonvim_running')\r\n        hi CursorLine ctermfg=white\r\n    else\r\n        hi CursorLine guifg=white\r\n    endif\r\nendfunction\r\n\r\naugroup OnColorScheme\r\n    autocmd!\r\n    autocmd ColorScheme,BufEnter,BufWinEnter * call s:CustomizeColors()\r\naugroup END\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis workaround is also included in my fork of base16-vim. However, it is not\r\nideal. It means that CursorLine has priority over (AFAIK) _everything_, not just\r\nNormal. This breaks Error highlighting in many base16 themes and I haven't\r\nthought of a fix for that yet.\r\n\r\nEDIT: also negatively affects Diff\\* highlights as @justinmk states in [this pull request](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8578#issuecomment-419710100)",

It works, but it's just so, so nasty to have to resort to something like that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's the only thing that makes CursorLine and CursorColumn actually work as they should - and as they do in vim8.",

            "body": "I was trying to install nvim from fresh and stumbled upon similar issue. Most of popular color schemes I tried have highlight artifacts (incorrect background colors with enabled `cursorline`, incorrect popup colors). \r\nHere are some examples with [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) (right side with fix applied):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/670602/126042923-9ae41e50-fb3c-4563-a960-f356612a521f.png)\r\n\r\nI asked _#neovim:matrix.org_ for help and **clason** pointed me to this issue.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a hack similar to suggested by @captnjameskirk: it copies over `Normal` highlight group, but drops any background attributes; then it re-link any groups linked to `Normal` to that new group. It's not well tested, I don't have much experience with vim/nvim configuration, but it does work for me.\r\n\r\nIf it could be useful for someone, here it is:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/DaTa-/04bf8ece1c2ee1f8cdf1038bd3bf84bf\r\n\r\nTo activate it, run this lua file after `colorscheme`. For example, I put the script at `~/.config/nvim/lua/hl_bg_fix.lua` and add this line to `init.vim` after `colorscheme` setting:\r\n```vim\r\ncolorscheme gruvbox\r\nruntime lua/hl_bg_fix.lua\r\n```",
