Setting it as background to either `Folded`, `CursorColumn`, or something else will make it invisible in floating windows.\n>     - Grey2 is used for Normal. Setting it as background will make it invisible in normal windows.\n>     - Grey3 is used for all other common UI elements: `CursorLine`, `CursorColumn`, `Folded`. Currently it is also used for `StatusLineNC`, but initially it was using Grey1. One of the reasons for this was *this specific issue* of not being the same to `CursorLine`, but it was deemed as bad usability and so Grey3 was chosen as the closest shade of Grey. See #26921.\n>     - Grey4 is mostly reserved for `Visual` as it being different from `CursorLine` is pretty crucial for usability: it has to be more noticeable for easier visual selection. Besides, having `CursorLine` be lighter (in dark theme) will hurt accessibility via lower contrast ratio.\n> \n> So with this in mind:\n> - Changing `CursorLine` to Grey1 will make it invisible in floating windows. Navigating inside floating windows is most certainly a more common scenario than cursor being near statusline in inactive normal window and *probably* more common than it being near the fold.\n> - Changing `Folded` to Grey4 is possible but I personally think that it makes folds be too visible, as Grey4 was *designed* to be more visible.\n\n@justinmk, here are the ways to resolve this with shades of grey (which I do think that they should be):\n- Change `Folded` to have Grey4. It indeed makes them *very* noticeable. I don't think optimizing its background color for the \"it may be near cursor line\" case is better than optimizing for the \"it needs to be looked at (and don't draw too much attention)\" case.\n- Revert #26921, at least for `StatusLineNC`. This will mean that inactive statusline will have Grey1 background. It will be different from `CursorLine` but less distinctive to serve as a \"window separation\". I don't think this is a good idea as window separation is indeed more important here than optimizing for \"it may be near cursor line\" case.\n- Change `StatusLineNC` to have Grey4 background. This will make window separation clearer, but I personally think it will draw too much attention to those lines (as Grey4 is designed to do). And again, optimizing for \"it should be constantly be looked at\" case has more priority than \"it can be near cursor line\".\n    Also note that changing `StatusLineNC` would require making a decision about `TabLine` which currently is linked to `StatusLineNC`. Having them linked makes more sense as default as what color schemes usually do is have tabline be slightly less visible statusline, which usually means being close to inactive statusline. Making them not link is okay too (and have `TabLine` be as it is now with Grey3 background), but it has to be considered.\n- Add more shades of grey. This is probably too much.\n\nAll in all, I think this issue should be closed as this is a result of a deliberate optimization towards more common cases. Both for `Folded` and `StatusLineNC`. Users can customize it to their liking by `:hi! link Folded Visual` and/or setting `Grey1` or `Grey4` for `StatusLineNC` / `CursorLine`.",

Can we try it?\n\nLet me take a couple of days to think it over. I've also realized that in my personal daily color schemes I moved away from `Folded` being the same as `CursorLine` at the cost of them being not visible in the floating windows. Which might be a better compromise for default also, i.e. prioritize \"make folds and cursor line different in Normal windows\" over \"make folds have different background in floating windows\". So maybe making `CursorLine` - `Folded` - `StatusLineNC` all different will make sense after all.\n\n> > changing `StatusLineNC` would require making a decision about `TabLine`\n> \n> Why wouldn't they stay linked?\n\nThey might, I said that it would require a decision. The argument against linking them would be that `TabLineFill` links to `TabLine` and it is better to not have a line on top (as `TabLineFill` usually covers most of the horizontal space in the tabline) that draws more attention than it needs to. But at the same time if `StatusLineNC` is made different from `CursorLine`, then it would mean that `TabLine`+`TabLineFill` will also be different, which is good.\n\n> > Add more shades of grey. This is probably too much.\n> \n> +1000, can we please do this :)\n\nI'd advise against it. Having eight shades of grey is totally enough for a usable color scheme. It is already enough for the default and is proven so in Base16 color schemes. Plus managing complexity/maintainability is a good thing.",
