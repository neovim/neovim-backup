N/A\n- Operating system/version: Arch Linux (64-bit Linux 4.6.3-1)\n- Terminal name/version: rxvt-unicode v9.22\n- `$TERM`: rxvt-256color\n### Actual behaviour\n\nText in Neovim terminal becomes clipped on the right side after reducing window size to a width smaller than what is displayed.\n### Expected behaviour\n\nTerminal text return to its original unclipped after the window is temporarily narrowed.\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\n1. nvim -u NORC\n2. Open a terminal using `:term` and then print some long line to the screen. Initially the entire text will be displayed:\n\n```\n$ echo \"abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy\"                                               \nabcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy \n```\n\nIf the screen is then resized (e.g. 50% width), and then resized back to 100% width, the text is now clipped at the position where it was hidden when the terminal size was reduced:\n\n```\n$ echo \"abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn op                                                                                       \nabcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy abcdefg hijklmn opqrstuv xzy \n```\n\n(Thanks @jalvesaq for coming up with this simple example to reproduce the issue).\n",

At least until (if ever) libvterm gains the ability to remember off-screen text.\n\n**edit:** @leonerd mentioned in gitter that this is currently the expected libvterm behavior.\n",

If so, you can delete my comment. I am using dwm window manager and I have so far loved the nvim terminal as my \"copy mode\" instead of my alacritty one. I would like to keep using nvim terminal but maybe I will give it up as default for now due to clipping at resize. I tried the above workaround just pasting it into command mode, but it makes no difference in v0.5.1. Is there today some working workaround config?",
