I'm raising this here, maybe Neovim is willing to break backwards compatibility to make things more consistent.\r\n\r\n* In case you're thinking that the `%%` in the first expression is the problem: `:set stl=%{''}%{&modified?'\\ M':''}` has the status line only contain `M`, with no leading space either.\r\n* Using `%F` or `%t` as the first part will keep the space, while `%r` or `%M` will drop it.\r\n* Adding a _second_ space in the second expression (`%{&modified?'\\ \\ M':''}`) will result in _one_ being printed.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, VIM 9.0.1378 (including 1499)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian 12 bookworm\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.26.5\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nAppImage, but also occurs with Debian's 0.7.2",
