What an irony. _But it was a fact._\n\nSo everywhere I had a 80-character long line it had either to wrap on new line or to hide on the right.\nThat was _very_ annoying untill I got the idea to make my font a little bit smaller.\n\nBut perhaps there are users with narrower screens who can't afford a smaller font so my solution would be unacceptable.\n",

All the fields in the fillchars option.\n\nThe fact that they occupy space affects one particular use case of a plug-in I've been developing. It's a distraction-free mode for [n]vim. The approach is to create padding buffers, around the main central buffer, and change some highlights. There are some calculations to decide the size of the padding buffers based on the user's defined size, being `zoom_height` & `zoom_width`. After some math, four variables are calculated, called: s:left, s:right, s:top & s:bottom. Here is the part where it creates one of the buffers:\n\n```vim\nif s:left>1\n    silent! exec string(s:left-1)..'vsplit '..g:zoom.buff\n    call zoom#buff()\n    silent! wincmd p\nendif\n```\nThe inconsistency arises when `s:left == 1`. That means, \"create a buffer (vsplit) of width 1\", but that is impossible, because any buffer has to have the split line (that occupies one column) and at least one column of workable area. The idea is equivalent for horizontal splits. By the way, the minus one in the formula is there to account for the space the split line occupies. \n\nIf there was a way of either remove the split lines (as in not create one) or allow `:resize` to accept a zero dimension, then the math would finally add up. But then, that is just one particular use case.\n\nFor reference, here is the source code of this ongoing project \n\nhttps://github.com/nvpm/devl/blob/ac0d680976fe6463692ed2c4ccdabdc048d62717/nvim/autoload/zoom.vim#L17",
