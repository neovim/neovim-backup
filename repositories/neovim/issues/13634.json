    "body": "While the language server protocol spec should allow for graceful fallback when a server doesn't broadcast certain capabilities, in reality this is not the case. Many language servers implicitly assume vscode's capabilities, especially those built using [vscode-languageserver-node](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node). This was first noted with pyright and jdtls which ignore dynamicRegistration settings and try to invoke the client/registerCapability handler. More recently, I discovered that vscode-json-languageserver will refuse to initialize the formatter unless dynamicRegistration is supported clientside. We could/should try to upstream issues (I filed the former issue already here https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/issues/713), I'm not sure the latter can really be called a bug and the issue tracker isn't open. I think it's a losing battle to try to upstream workarounds, and would be better to implement dynamicRegistration in core. I'm currently working on a PR, but wanted to open the issue to point those posting in nvim-lspconfig to something to watch. ",
