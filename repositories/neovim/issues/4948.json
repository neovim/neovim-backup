    "body": "This is fundamentally a proposed enhancement.\n\nThe Vim `compiler/:make` system is a real boon to productivity that I've only recently started to really explore. \n\nOne of its shortcomings are the limitations of the 'errorformat' system. The docs hint at them with the suggestion of adding a filter to the 'makeprg' setting to product \"formattable\" output. The problem there is that the filter conceals the error code of the make program, which can be useful for other tools.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is an 'errorfunc' setting, that would consume the output of 'makeprg' as a list of lines and be directly responsible for populating the appropriate quickfix/location list. The default implementation would examine the 'errorformat' setting and behave exactly as the current system does.\n",
