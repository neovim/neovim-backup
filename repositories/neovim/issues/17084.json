Currently, I use `ea`, `Ea`, `bi` and `Bi`, none of them can be repeated with a dot command. Someone told me that `I` and `A` are simply `^i` and `$a` commands, which were made atomic. I though maybe its not hard to add `<A-i>`, `<A-I>`, `<A-a>` and `<A-A>` atomic commands for `ea`, `Ea`, `bi` and `Bi`? Or at least some kind of aliased atomic commands, which I could use in my mappings?\r\n\r\nI have asked in stackoverflow.com if its possible to implement these shortcuts:\r\nhttps://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/36462/how-to-append-to-the-end-of-word-with-one-key-stroke\r\nhttps://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/36482/how-to-insert-to-the-beginning-of-a-word-with-one-key-stroke\r\n\r\nBut its only possible for `ea` and `Ea` with `ce<C-r>-` and `cE<C-r>-` commands and not possible for `bi`, `Bi`, even with reapeat.vim plugin help.\r\n",
