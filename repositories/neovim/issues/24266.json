Not sure what's the simplest way of resolving the conflict. I was thinking that it should be based on when `setlocal` was called (the newest `setlocal` takes priority). But does that mean that you need to store additional timestamp metadata? Or is there a simpler heuristic?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
