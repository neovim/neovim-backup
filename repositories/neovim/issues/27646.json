This exclude_pattern could be exposed to the user so that other folders could be excluded, for example when attaching a client.\r\n\r\nThis was commented already on the PR #23500:\r\n\r\n            @folke I wonder if exposing a variable like this would make it possible to exclude additional patterns per language, like `target` for rust.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nojnhuh in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/23500#discussion_r1222310377_\r\n            \r\nFrom my experience, when working with rust, if we have cargo building or even sometimes when running an executable from the `target` folder, neovim complains with EPERM errors like this:\r\n```\r\nError executing luv callback:\r\n...\\neovim\\nvim-win64\\share\\nvim\\runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua:68: EPERM: operation not permitted: c:/Projects/Other/Rust/b\r\nudgetLookup/target/release/deps/libunicode_ident-1737a7a6bd2cc11e.rlib.temp-archive-536a548.a\r\nstack traceback:\r\n        [C]: in function 'assert'\r\n        ...\\neovim\\nvim-win64\\share\\nvim\\runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua:68: in function <...\\neovim\\nvim-win64\\share\\nvim\\ru\r\nntime/lua/vim/_watch.lua:55>\r\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\r\nError executing luv callback:\r\n...\\neovim\\nvim-win64\\share\\nvim\\runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua:68: EPERM: operation not permitted: c:/Projects/Other/Rust/b\r\nudgetLookup/target/release/deps/libunicode_ident-1737a7a6bd2cc11e.rlib.temp-archive-536a548.a\r\nstack traceback:\r\n        [C]: in function 'assert'\r\n        ...\\neovim\\nvim-win64\\share\\nvim\\runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua:68: in function <...\\neovim\\nvim-win64\\share\\nvim\\ru\r\nntime/lua/vim/_watch.lua:55>\r\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\r\n```\r\nThis errors keep showing all the time and I can't seem to find a way to stop them. If I could add the `target` folder to the `exclude_pattern` of watchfiles on the `on_attach` function of the rust-analyzer lsp it could probably fix this.\r\n\r\nThis is related to rust, but it could help on other situations of other LSPs, like the problem with the `.venv` folders of python mentioned on the PR above.\r\n\r\nIf someone knows if there is another way of fixing this without exposing this to the user, please tell me.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe expected behavior would be no errors of `EPERM` should show for files under `target` folder or any other folder that the LSP shouldn't be watching.",

            "body": "So I've tested this with other projects where `rust-analyzer` is not registering any `target` folder as a watcher and this potential fix still doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that on Windows and Mac it is using the `watch` function of the `_watch.lua` file, but on Linux it uses the `poll` function which then calls the `recurse_watch` function. The problem is that the `watch` function completely ignores the `include_pattern` and `exclude_pattern` from the `opts`. Only the `recurse_watch` function actually considers these options.\r\n\r\nI've tried adding the check on the `watch` function as well and that actually fixed it for me. Even if I don't add the `+ glob.to_lpeg('**/target/**')` to the `M._poll_exclude_pattern` because now it will only watch the folders that match the `include_pattern` but I'm not entirely sure if that is the intended purpose. I've also not been able to actually test if the watching is being properly done, so there is a chance that my fix is only stopping the watcher logic completely and that is why it fixes it.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Here is the fix I used:</summary>\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n--- Initializes and starts a |uv_fs_event_t|\r\n---\r\n---@param path (string) The path to watch\r\n---@param opts (table|nil) Additional options\r\n---     - uvflags (table|nil)\r\n---                Same flags as accepted by |uv.fs_event_start()|\r\n---@param callback (function) The function called when new events\r\n---@return (function) Stops the watcher\r\nfunction M.watch(path, opts, callback)\r\n  vim.validate({\r\n    path = { path, 'string', false },\r\n    opts = { opts, 'table', true },\r\n    callback = { callback, 'function', false },\r\n  })\r\n  opts = opts or {}\r\n\r\n  local function is_included(filepath)\r\n    return opts.include_pattern and opts.include_pattern:match(filepath)\r\n  end\r\n  local function is_excluded(filepath)\r\n    return opts.exclude_pattern and opts.exclude_pattern:match(filepath)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  path = vim.fs.normalize(path)\r\n  if not is_excluded(path) then\r\n    local uvflags = opts and opts.uvflags or {}\r\n    local handle, new_err = vim.uv.new_fs_event()\r\n    assert(not new_err, new_err)\r\n    handle = assert(handle)\r\n    local _, start_err = handle:start(path, uvflags, function(err, filename, events)\r\n      assert(not err, err)\r\n      local fullpath = path\r\n      if filename then\r\n        filename = filename:gsub('\\\\', '/')\r\n        fullpath = filepath_join(fullpath, filename)\r\n      end\r\n      if is_included(fullpath) and not is_excluded(path) then\r\n        local change_type = events.change and M.FileChangeType.Changed or 0\r\n        if events.rename then\r\n          local _, staterr, staterrname = vim.uv.fs_stat(fullpath)\r\n          if staterrname == 'ENOENT' then\r\n            change_type = M.FileChangeType.Deleted\r\n          else\r\n            assert(not staterr, staterr)\r\n            change_type = M.FileChangeType.Created\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n        callback(fullpath, change_type)\r\n      end\r\n    end)\r\n    assert(not start_err, start_err)\r\n    return function()\r\n      stop(handle)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n  return function () end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n</details>",
