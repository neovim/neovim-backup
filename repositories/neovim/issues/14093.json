    "body": "In #14079 I added incremental sync. We're required to keep a copy of the buffer around in order to compute the difference between the current buffer state and last buffer state. In theory, we should be able to do this with the on_bytes callback, however, currently on_bytes has issues with line joins that prevent detecting all buffer change events we need to send (see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14043).\r\n\r\nI went ahead and implemented a version of incremental sync using on_bytes #16247 which is currently broken due to the aforementioned issue.\r\n\r\nOf note, due to the LSP specification's \"decision\" to use utf-16 instead of utf-8, with the current implementation we still need to carry around the previous buffer (like the current incremental sync does) to compute the utf-16 code units as unlike on_lines, this is not returned from on_bytes. We only need this technically for start_row, start_col -> old_end_row, old_end_column as new_end_row/new_end_col is only used to grab the changed text to be sent to the server, for which we only need the byte info. The current utf-16 *length* is not enough, because the code units are required to provide the start/end range which is relative to the start/end rows.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to have a mode that supports internally treating \\r as a new line, but that is likely out of scope :)\r\n\r\nSummary of what would be needed from the on_bytes implementation for this to work:\r\n* return start_row, start_col, new_end_row, new_end_col in utf-8, utf-16, or utf-32 units (depending on the server) as well as the (current) new text in sync with the latest copy of the buffer, including updates following undos and joins.\r\n\r\n",
