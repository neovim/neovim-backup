I think something as essential as this, shouldn't have any dependencies.\r\nAlso it misses the stats for Neovim itself. It can profile system plugins, but profiling Neovim itself is just as important for putting the numbers in comparison. I mean, reducing plugin startuptime from 10 to 5 ms might seem like a good idea, when not seeing the startuptime of Neovim itself. But when compared to 80 ms startuptime for Neovim itself, it was just an exercise task.\r\n\r\nThe second problem with vim-profiler is that it depends on which plugin-manager you use. For example it doesn't work with [dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim). It also doesn't work on Windows.",
