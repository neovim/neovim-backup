I haven’t dug into the source code yet—**is it possible for third-party plugins to implement a similar mechanism?** Or is there already a supported way to achieve client-side execution?\n\nThanks for your guidance!\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe client could loads a local init script when starting, for example:\n```\nnvim -u /path/to/host/init.lua --server host:port --remote-ui\n```\n\nThrough some mechanism—possibly an RPC notification—the script at `/path/to/host/init.lua` could handle commands or requests originating from the server via RPC notificatioon.\n\nFor example, a hypothetical command like:\n```vim\n:HostShell ls\n```",
