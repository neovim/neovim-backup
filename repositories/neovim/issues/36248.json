Opening Netrw any other way does not open it in a buffer (with `Vex`, `Lex`, `Sex`, `Rex`...). And Vim does not do that either in any case, even with `vim .`\n\nAnother inconsistency happens when you choose any file, it will open it just fine. Then if you which buffers twice, the Netrw buffer disappears on it's own.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- `nvim .` to open a directory, Netrw will show up\n- `:ls`, notice that there is a buffer for Netrw (Vim does not do that)\n- Open any file in Netrw, it will open it in a buffer\n- `:ls` to see that you have 2 buffers (Vim will have only one)\n- `:bn` to get back to Netrw\n- `:bn` to get back to the open file\n- `:ls` to see that the Netrw has disappeared on it's own\n- `:bn` will not switch you back to Netrw any more, as it's gone\n- You can also open Netrw again with `:Rex`, there won't be any new buffer created for it\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nOpening an Nvim on a directory should not create a buffer for Netrw, consistently to what Vim does, and other commands in the same way as other Netrw commands do (Rex, Vex ...)\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.1.697\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux, KDE\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nKonsole (KDE)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nPrebuilt binary Linux binary from Github (not the appimage)",
