So, if something can be done, we should strive for it.\n\nA possible solution crossed by mind: A \"bang command provider\", which would be responsible for running non-filtered shell commands.\n\nSuch a provider could be implemented as a python plugin for example, using a newly spawned window/buffer as a terminal emulator. Since there are many ready to use terminal emulation libraries for python, the plugin part should be relatively easy to accomplish. Though I'm still not sure if we have a way to redirect every keypress in a buffer/window to a user function.\n",

While we diverged the behavior of `system()` and `!`, it was for allowing the full client server architecture planned from the beginning of the project. We can't have UIs running in different processes and have programs require nvim stdio inheritance in order to display output.\n\nAlso, its not like vim behavior is consistent anyway, gvim also has limited support for interactive programs in `!` and `system()`(which is why plugins like fzf and selecta dont work in gvim).\n\nI hope we'll eventually be able to run full interactive programs with `!` and `system()`, this should be possible by making some enhancements to the terminal module and have it draw directly to the screen(instead of a buffer), but it is not a primary goal.\n",

This breaks just so many workflows, as all the bug reports referencing this issue show. Personally, I've always done `!less %` for getting a quick view of the current file for copy/paste in the terminal without disrupting my vim layout. This now is no longer possible (I'd now have do `Ctrl-z`, `less <filename>`, `fg`). If you're going to change the behavior of `!`, at least provide some different mechanism to achieve the old behavior, so I can create a custom mapping!\r\n\r\nEdit: @phodge's workaround solves my problem for now. But still, while I understand the reasoning behind the new behavior of `!`, you should be extremely wary of any user-facing change that'll break compatibility with terminal-vim, and provide an easy work-around if you have to.",

I'm subscribed to this issue because in the beginning it was super weird for me that this issue exist on Neovim and I thought I can't use Neovim until it's solved, so I subscribed to this issue but in next few hours I found out how to update my vimrc (`init.vim`) and then I forgot this issue even exist. I don't remember the changes I had to do, but I remember it didn't take more than few hours.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to list the things that are affected by this issue and are annoying you and we'll try to provide you solutions.",
