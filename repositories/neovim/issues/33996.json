This problem is the same whether using the mainline .msi binary release or the msys2 packaged release. \n\ninit.vim includes: \n\nset shellcmdflag=-c\nset shell=C:\\\\msys64\\\\usr\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\n\n###\n\nnvim -V\n\n###\n\n:! ls (works) \n:r !ls  \n\nExecuting command: \"ls >C:\\msys64\\tmp\\nvim.0\\lzMwxj\\0 2>&1\"\nshell returned 127\nE485: Can't read file C:\\msys64\\tmp\\nvim.0\\lzMwxj\\0\n\n###\n\nNote that CMD.exe formatting is used even though bash is specified. The lack of double escaped backslash or single quoted string is causing mis-evaluation of the tmp file path, and no tmp files are written or read. \n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim -V\n:! ls (works) \n:r !ls  \n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShould work like vim or nvi\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nmintty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nMsys2",
