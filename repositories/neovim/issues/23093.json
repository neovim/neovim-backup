I came up with a function to disconnect all remote-ui sessions:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n  vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>q', function()\r\n    for _, ui in pairs(vim.api.nvim_list_uis()) do\r\n      if ui.chan and not ui.stdout_tty then\r\n        vim.fn.chanclose(ui.chan)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end, { noremap = true })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is working for my use case, but I am not 100% sure that ui.stdout_tty is the correct condition to check. But, if I use your nohup commands in combination with this I can have a long living neovim session. Hopefully this helps someone 🙂",

            "body": "I've been thinking about the problem some more and I think the ideal way to do this would be an API function that returns information about the client that made the API request (similar to how many Web APIs have a /me/ or /self/ endpoint that returns information about the API client/authenticated app).\r\n\r\nAt minimum, this would return the server side of the UI channel that gets returned by `nvim_list_uis`.\r\n\r\nThe reason `set_client_info` by itself is insufficient is that even if the TUI uniquely identifies itself, the client has to iterate over *all* UIs, then call `get_chan_info` for each one, then look at the `client` info to try and identify itself. But that requires some ability to retrieve/compare the client info against the one retrieved from the API.\r\n\r\nHowever, as far as I can tell, all process related APIs run in the context of the server, not the client. E.g. `uv.os_getpid()` alwats returns the PID of the server, not the client. So I'm not sure where the client would hold onto its unique data to be able to retrieve it during this step.\r\n\r\nThe server however can very quickly figure out which client sent an API/RPC request, so a 'who am I' function would be fairly straightforward to implement on the server side, and it would sidestep the issue of needing to check the channel of every single UI, and the issue of every client needing to have some way to uniquely identify itself out of the list of UIs, and needing.\r\n\r\nActually, looking at the docs `nvim_get_chan_info` says it takes a 'channel_id, or 0 for current channel'. I believe 0 is currently only applicable in the context of channel callbacks. Maybe `get_chan_info(0)` outside of a callback could be made to return the current API client's channel?\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar enough with the exact ins and outs of Neovim's current client/server architecture, but I do think something along the lines of what I described would be the best way to move towards detachable UIs.",

Any other client can call `nvim_get_chan_info(0)` to get its channel id. But the `nvim` builtin UI client doesn't expose a way for users/plugins to execute code from its \"local\" context.\n\nFor the default case where the nvim ui spawns the server as a *child* process, I think it should work if (1) the `nvim` server is spawned with `detach=true`, (2) terminating the *parent* (ui) process should allow the *child* (server) to continue running.\n\nFor the non-default case (`nvim --remote-ui`), there are some obvious potential workarounds, such as storing a flag (`nvim --server ./hello.sock --remote-send ':let ui=42<cr>' && nvim --remote-ui ...`).\n\nI see least two clear next steps:\n\n1. ~~`nvim --server ... +cmd` should execute `+cmd` in the remote server.~~\n    - Oh, `nvim --server ... --remote +cmd` works. bleh.\n2. ✅ For the builtin nvim TUI, \"current UI\" has no mapping to the list of UIs.\n    - If I run `:detach`, how will the server know which UI is the \"current UI\"?\n    - ~~The UI can listen for `ctrl-z` and handle it specially.~~ Or all input sent from a UI would be mapped to the relevant channel id. \n3. ✅ the builtin UI should call `nvim_set_client_info` to provide all possible info about itself, including PID.\n    - but that still doesn't solve (2).\n",
