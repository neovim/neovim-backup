    "body": "### Problem\n\nNvim started freezing almost every session for me. Eventually I found that my `~/.cache/nvim/luac` directory has more than 250,000 files in it.\n\nThese appear to be cache files generated and named according to the path of the original lua file.\n\nThe problem is the `nvim.appimage` release mounts nvim at a different temporary path each time it is invoked. The naming scheme of these cache files changes, then on every invocation, making the cache pointless and creating N additional files on every launch of nvim. For me, that led to a directory that currently has 246,768 files in it.\n\nHere is an example of 2 identical files in the the `./luac/` directory that are named differently only because the temporary mounting paths generated by appimage are different:\n\n`%2ftmp%2f.mount_nvim.a65Rja0%2fusr%2fshare%2fnvim%2fruntime%2flua%2fvim%2ftreesitter.luac`\n`%2ftmp%2f.mount_nvim.aNpxXgo%2fusr%2fshare%2fnvim%2fruntime%2flua%2fvim%2ftreesitter.luac`\n\nI originally encountered this with the 0.9.5 appimage on RHEL7, but have confirmed the v0.11.0-dev-1129+gadbffff5d0 pre-release still behaves the same way.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1) install `nvim.appimage`\n2) `mv ~/.cache/nvim/luac ~/.cache/nvim/luac.backup`\n3) `nvim`\n4) Observe contents of `~/.cache/nvim/luac/`\n5) Close nvim and run `nvim` again\n6) Observe contents of `~/.cache/nvim/luac/` and see that new identical files have been added with a different mount prefix\n\nEvery time `nvim` is launched, more files are added.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExpected behavior is not to allow unbounded growth of the number of files in `~/.cache/nvim/luac/`.\n\nWhen using `nvim.appimage`, the cache is effectively rendered moot between launches of nvim. A simple workaround to address the problem I'm experiencing would be to either not cache or remove cached luac files on close when appimage is used.\n\nA more ideal solution would allow the cached files to be used and probably involves some sort of translation of appimage mount paths to a common filename in the cache directory that can be shared among multiple instances of nvim that are compatible (same version?)\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-dev-1129+gadbffff5d0 all the way back to v0.9.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nunlikely since these are lua cache files? Not sure how to even check this.\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nRHEL9.3, RHEL7, and RHEL8\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nzsh 5.8\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage",

We need proposals that provide long-term solutions. Here are some ideas.\n\n- `vim.loader` should not cache more than X files. it should prune old files exceeding a maximum number\n    - this concept of \"log rotation\" is useful for logs and plugins, so probably should be provided as a util.\n- the concept of deciding a fixed/stable \"filesystem root\" applies to 'undodir', swap, and other cases. and this is also useful for plugins, but there is no standard interface. we may need an abstraction like `vim.xx.filepath_to_filename()`.",

So in practice, directory of the cache doesn't change, what changes is the .luac file name and the variance comes from as you mentioned, appimage generating different names due to some randomness. I'm not sure what's a good long term solution where except having some control to suppress that randomness either within appimage or externally.\n\nI.e. those generated paths seems to be very consistent at least on Linux with only one tiny part being variable. So it's not really hard to build in a workaround without even any explicitly configurable regexes, that detects this condition and chops out the random part.\n\nSince appimage is only provided for Linux, may be there is no need to worry about too much variations and just focus on that small part expecting the rest to be consistent?\n\nLimiting number of files isn't a good workaround, since it actually still not providing the purpose of the cache (files will still be different duplicates in practice, just won't multiple without limit).",

Disabling the loader / caching prevents the growth, but the downside is that it also doesn't cache luac that don't get mixed up.\n\nI.e. just to clarify, there are two groups of files there:\n\n1. Ones without randomness in the name (that comes from plugins installed with plugin manager).\n2. Ones with randomness in the name. That comes from neovim's internal Lua modules that are inside appimage.\n\nSo at least for files from group 1 there is a benefit in having that cache enabled.\n\n> Probably vim.loader can workaround this automatically, by figuring out what the program image path is and discarding it.\n\nYep, that's exactly what I was suggesting above, as a follow up to first idea.

I just verified it, yes, if I install neovim nightly via my OS/package manager, then obviously, the paths it complained about do exist on disk and it loads correctly.
