    "body": "### Problem\n\nNvim started freezing almost every session for me. Eventually I found that my `~/.cache/nvim/luac` directory has more than 250,000 files in it.\n\nThese appear to be cache files generated and named according to the path of the original lua file.\n\nThe problem is the `nvim.appimage` release mounts nvim at a different temporary path each time it is invoked. The naming scheme of these cache files changes, then on every invocation, making the cache pointless and creating N additional files on every launch of nvim. For me, that led to a directory that currently has 246,768 files in it.\n\nHere is an example of 2 identical files in the the `./luac/` directory that are named differently only because the temporary mounting paths generated by appimage are different:\n\n`%2ftmp%2f.mount_nvim.a65Rja0%2fusr%2fshare%2fnvim%2fruntime%2flua%2fvim%2ftreesitter.luac`\n`%2ftmp%2f.mount_nvim.aNpxXgo%2fusr%2fshare%2fnvim%2fruntime%2flua%2fvim%2ftreesitter.luac`\n\nI originally encountered this with the 0.9.5 appimage on RHEL7, but have confirmed the v0.11.0-dev-1129+gadbffff5d0 pre-release still behaves the same way.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1) install `nvim.appimage`\n2) `mv ~/.cache/nvim/luac ~/.cache/nvim/luac.backup`\n3) `nvim`\n4) Observe contents of `~/.cache/nvim/luac/`\n5) Close nvim and run `nvim` again\n6) Observe contents of `~/.cache/nvim/luac/` and see that new identical files have been added with a different mount prefix\n\nEvery time `nvim` is launched, more files are added.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExpected behavior is not to allow unbounded growth of the number of files in `~/.cache/nvim/luac/`.\n\nWhen using `nvim.appimage`, the cache is effectively rendered moot between launches of nvim. A simple workaround to address the problem I'm experiencing would be to either not cache or remove cached luac files on close when appimage is used.\n\nA more ideal solution would allow the cached files to be used and probably involves some sort of translation of appimage mount paths to a common filename in the cache directory that can be shared among multiple instances of nvim that are compatible (same version?)\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-dev-1129+gadbffff5d0 all the way back to v0.9.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nunlikely since these are lua cache files? Not sure how to even check this.\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nRHEL9.3, RHEL7, and RHEL8\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nzsh 5.8\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage",
