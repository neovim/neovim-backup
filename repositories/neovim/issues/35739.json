    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovide added IME pre-edit support with API support https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/3110 and a plugin https://github.com/kanium3/neovide-ime.nvim. However, it had to immediately be reverted due to hangs when blocking message prompts were showing.\n\nThe reason for this was that `nvim_input` was changed to `nvim_exec_lua`, which calls a lua function to perform the actual input. But that lua function never gets executed when a message prompt is showing, even when it's a direct replacement like this\n```lua\nM.commit_handler = function(commit_raw_text, commit_formatted_text)\n    vim.api.nvim_input(commit_formatted_text)\nend\n```\n\nThe actual pre-edit functionality is complex, won't be possible, and doesn't even make sense when a message is waiting for input, so what we would like to have is a function like this:\n\n```lua\nM.commit_handler = function(commit_raw_text, commit_formatted_text)\n    if vim.in_fast_event() then\n        vim.api.nvim_input(commit_formatted_text)\n    else\n        -- do pre-edit stuff here\n    end\nend\n```\n\nBut as mentioned this does not work, due to `nvim_exec_lua` not being marked as `FUNC_API_FAST`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAn UI should be able to execute lua code when nvim is in a fast even handler. It could be done by changing `nvim_exec_lua` to allow it, but that can cause breakage, so maybe another more limited function could be added?\n\nNote, we don't want to do extra roundtrips by checking `vim.in_fast_event()` on the nvim side, which is not even possible to do in an atomic manner, so there could be race conditions.",

Those are things the plugin will take care of.\n\nThe default implementation without the plugin and pre-edit support is this.\n```lua\n---@param preedit_raw_text string\n---@param cursor_offset? [integer, integer] (start_col, end_col) This values show the cursor begin position and end position. The position is byte-wise indexed.\nM.preedit_handler = function(preedit_raw_text, cursor_offset) end\n\n---@param commit_raw_text string\n---@param commit_formatted_text string It's escaped.\nM.commit_handler = function(commit_raw_text, commit_formatted_text)\n    vim.api.nvim_input(commit_formatted_text)\nend\n```\nBut that already breaks because Neovide can't call it when nvim is blocking for input.",

Terminals could also support it with a custom protocol, many already support IME with pre-edit, but it's only designed for the command line and can't really deal with the windows inside Neovim.\n\nBut currently the implementation is too unstable to even attempt including. And that's also the same reason I didn't want to include it directly in Neovide at this point and exposed an API hook instead.\n\nBut I think even the API hook is too unstable at the moment to standardize in Neovim. As mentioned before, the IME system supports more than we currently attempt to do, for example you can give it surrounding text. https://wayland.app/protocols/wayland-protocols/368#wp_input_method_v3:event:surrounding_text.\n\nSo, to me allowing remote clients to execute lua in a fast API context, seems like the solution for now. I don't see much reason to disallow that when a regular lua plugin also can execute lua code at that time by using `vim.uv` timers for example. But on the other hand, I can't think of that many other use cases either. Maybe smooth trackpad scrolling could benefit from being able to preprocess the mouse input on the nvim side before it's actually delivered. But I haven't thought much about that as an option.",

It's a bit wasteful to compile the code on every call,\n> \n> unlikely to matter vs the other costs of an RPC call.\n\nMaybe it doesn't matter, I haven't benchmarked. But the RPC overhead is mostly in other threads and doesn't block the main loop. While the lua code needs to run through the lexer, then parser, then compiled to bytecode, then take a JIT compilation hit because it's always run the first time. \n\n> \n> > We can easily detect new functions and changed functions from the api metadata.

We have for example checked for the presence of functions and for UI event signatures. \n\nNeovide should always, if possible, work with any Neovim version, except when we cut support from older versions and the user is clearly notified at startup. It can of course break from bugs and Neovim breaking changes, which we should preferably be able to detect and work around even before they are merged to Neovim.\n\nWe also want to test various features and bug fixes before the release. In this case, we want to make sure the IME support works before the Neovim 0.12 is released, so we don't need to stall all development and testing until then. And users should be able to do that by just installing a new enough Neovim nightly user and a new enough Neovide main version. It should still not crash for users that have older nightly Neovim versions if we can prevent it. So, in this case, we can't just enable the IME API without checks once the fast API support is in.\n\nWe have the same issue with the grid 0 support, this can't be detected either, so in that case we are going to add a configuration option to enable it, which I don't like at all, but that's the only option we have.\n\nWe could refuse to start, but we can't since Neovim nightly builds don't include any date or incremental number that we can check. Any of those would be preferable over direct feature detection, but we don't have it.\n\nIt's also very idealistic to think that users either stay on a stable release or update every day. Many people want a certain nightly feature, and update to that version and stay there until the release.\n\nI guess plugins are not as affected by this, since breakages often affect only the plugin itself. Lua is also more dynamic and can handle error situations better.",

Currently the requests are added to the queue first and the unpacking of the arguments are done when actually handling it. When using an `fast` as an option, the unpacking has to be done before processing it. That seems like a risky overkill to implement if `nvim_exec_lua_fast` is the only function that will need it. The remote can always use `nvim_exec_lua_fast` to wrap the other needs.\n\nThe contract changes to allow `opts` everywhere does also not sound like something that will be done soon. And Neovide would like to experiment with the IME support, one of our most requested features soon. Especially when we for a brief moment had support for it, which received great positive feedback from Chinese user, who consider something like that mandatory and expected, but had to be reverted due to hangs.\n\nCould `nvim_exec_lua_fast` at least be added as an experimental API that can be removed in the future when we have a better alternative?\n",
