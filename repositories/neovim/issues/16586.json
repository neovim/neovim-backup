Even considering insert mode alone, InsertCharPre is not general enough for all the scenarios.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nFire an autocommand (suggested name: TextChangedPre or TextChange) before any change is applied to the buffer. By \"change\" I refer to the same changes considered for TextChanged; in fact, this feature could be implemented as \"everywhere a TextChanged would be fired, add a TextChange before it\".\r\n\r\nFor the use-case I have in mind, the distinction between TextChange*I*, TextChange*P*, TextChange, does not matter, but it might be justifiable on the same basis as it's done for the `TextChanged` counterpart.",
