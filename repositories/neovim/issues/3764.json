When the passed path is relative the buffer name becomes relative, when it's absolute the buffer name becomes absolute. But then `:cd X` and `:lcd X` rename the buffers to become absolute if outside X, otherwise relative. Even worse: an `:lcd` in any window will also update names for other windows (indeed, this is the reason my hack -see below- works).\n\nThis behavior is not consistent and thus confusing: sometimes absolute means outside the current working directory, sometimes not. For quickfix, which parses the output of external command, this often implies that files in the current directory are shown with absolute paths (in case the external command happens to report the full path). I would go to say the behavior is wrong.\n\nThis was discussed a time ago in vim mailing list but never really addressed:   \n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_use/Vq0z2DJH2So\n\n(And see my awful workaround at the end: `0split | lcd . | quit`, I would like to remove it from my config for good!)\n\nThere are two issues described there:\n- [ ] Consistently set buffer names on creation. The obvious rule is: relative if inside current working directory, otherwise absolute.\n- [ ] It would be nice if `getcwd()` could specify whether the desired cwd is the local or the global one. \n",

The \"always absolute\" criterion will thus imply that everywhere the buffer name could be shown, a decision must be taken about how to show it. One place is the modeline. Another place is the buffer list (I wouldn't like to get long absoulte paths for files in the current working directory there). There will be other places, for sure. \"Always absolute\" is logically more sound, as it separates different concerns, but could trigger the need for a number of new format options (how to show the buffer name here and there). \"Relative inside the cwd/Absolute outside the cwd\" could be a simpler to implement compromise (I guess it's just a matter of normalizing the name on file buffer creation), as it's what vim/nvim already poorly does.\n",

            "body": "@azure-satellite I cannot say that I know all places where file names are compared, so you had some chances to prove yourself. But what I do know is the existence of `b_ffname` `buf_T` structure attribute which makes these chances unlikely and one of the points in defence of your position invalid.\n\nBy the way, one thing absolute paths: Vim tends to use `~/`-style paths in many places and sometimes even compare _these_ paths: e.g. replacing ~absolute path with /absolute path was advertised as one of the advantages of ShaDa format (which also simplified some code). I.e. buffer had `b_ffname` attribute, but viminfo file for some reason contained ~absolute path and thus determining one of the global marks belongs to one of the existing buffers involved iterating over buffers, using `home_replace_save` on each `b_ffname` (which turns /absolute to ~absolute) and only then comparing the paths for equality (do not ask me why instead of doing this ~absolute path was not expanded to /absolute when reading mark). I simply use plain `b_ffname` in ShaDa code because this is clearer then messing with ~absolute paths in any fashion, even in saner one. ~absolute paths are still used in a number of places: e.g. in swap file headers.\n\nThus even if absolute paths are the way to go, there is still a question whether they need to be ~absolute when possible.\n\n---\n\n~absolute is short-hand for “`~/`-style absolute path” (example: `~/.config/nvim`).\n\n/absolute is a short-hand for “fully expanded absolute path” (example: `/home/zyx/.config/nvim`).\n",
