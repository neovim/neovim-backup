It only occurs when DECSET 2048 was enabled, causing the terminal to send `CSI 48` window resize notifications.\n\nI noticed that `tui_grid_resize` already contains logic to prevent this issue when the window resize notification comes via a SIGWINCH:\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/tui.c#L1228\n\nBut since the resize notification comes through this path instead:\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/input.c#L727\n\nThen `got_winch` is never set to true and it attempts to resize the window in response to the window resize request. \n\nIt looks like `got_winch` was added in 1803b0ffd7f08b50a3f59272ebe7290ffd21e90f for a completely different purpose, accidentally preventing the issue in question until DECSET 48 support was added somewhat recently.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPer the original user's repro steps (which I was able to replicate):\n\n1. have 2 iterm2 window tabs open, open nvim on them both.\n2. have a split pane in one of the window tabs.\n3. set the font to SauceCodePro Nerd Font Regular 17\n\nYou'll probably need to use their iTerm2 config since it depends on various settings like having window resizing enabled.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo resize loops.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nDidn't test it\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niTerm2 3.6.0beta1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew",
