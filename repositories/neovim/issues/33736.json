Release beta and stable versions separately, and register the beta version with all surface bugs fixed as a stable version. And if a bug occurs in an old version, fix the bug in that version and apply it to the later versions by chain rebase merge. Don't create any more mutants.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n.",
