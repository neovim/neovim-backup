In a pure Farsi text, all characters are shown from right to left, and Vim can handle this too using <code>:set rl</code>.

To do so `virtcol` implementation must know which display cell farsi symbol occupies in GUI.\n\nI do not think moving through paragraphs will be affected at all, but inline motions like `h`, `f`, `t`, `w` are different. I do not write in farsi so cannot say what will be convenient for writers, but I think it would be consistent if displayed direction is kept: `h` from “english content” will move to first displayed farsi character, not to the next character in byte stream, `f` and `t` will also find first displayed farsi character. It would be harder to code though.\n",

If the text is mostly Hebrew the :RTL options serves well.\r\nWhen BIDI is on something funky happens every time depending on the terminal. It can be displayed rtl but then for example when I type in text suddenly inverts. Also there is no way to control, unlike in Writer/Word,  the direction which the lines are displayed so lets say I want to write a hebrew text but one line begins with a number or a latin letter- than that line would be ltr oriented but any line which begins with a hebrew char begins from the right edge.  And for example if I am writing code and I want to insert a long hebrew string somewhere, than I don't want the lines to suddenly begin from the right edge it is just simple that everything is ltr and there is no unpredictable directionality changes.",

Maybe `arabicshape` should be effectively disabled when `set norl`, if it is broken then. It would simplify the code also (only need to deal with shaping in the rl branches).",

            "body": "NVim (and any sophisticated app which does its own BiDi) should do the following. (I should add a new section to the document about this.)\r\n\r\n- Switch to \"Explicit\" mode, and back to \"Implicit\" when quitting.\r\n\r\n- Decide whether it wishes to always use \"Explicit LTR\", or in some cases \"Explicit RTL\".\r\n\r\n  - Always using \"Explicit LTR\" is the safe bet, this is the legacy behavior that every terminal emulator supports.\r\n\r\n    In this case the \"designed correct\" behavior is that you switch to \"LTR\" at startup, and to the \"default direction\" when quitting. In practice, currently in VTE these two are the same (I'm not sure about MinTTY, the other terminal that implemented BiDi according to the new proposal), but in a couple of years VTE might also introduce an \"RTL is the default\" behavior and then it'll make a difference.\r\n\r\n    Also note that some terminals (e.g. Linux console, urxvt) have a faulty parser and perform side effects on these escape sequences. It's a philosophical question whether to push them to fixing these bugs, or to play safe and avoid hitting these issues.\r\n\r\n  - \"Explicit RTL\" offers better copy-pasting experience (the order of letters, as well as excluding the spaces after (= to the left of) the end of a line), better search functionality in the terminal – these kinds of subtle things.\r\n\r\n    In this case you need to switch to \"RTL\" at startup, and back to the \"default direction\" on exit. It's up to you whether you wish to disable \"keyboard arrow swapping\" or not; if you disable then you should re-enable when you quit.\r\n\r\n    \"Explicit RTL\" should only be enabled if a terminal that supports this feature is detected/assumed, via magic (e.g. checking $VTE_VERSION >= 5703) or a config option.\r\n\r\n  - It's possible to use a mixture of \"Explicit LTR\" and \"Explicit RTL\" on a per-line basis. E.g. \"Explicit RTL\" for the document area if an RTL text file is loaded, and \"Explicit LTR\" for the status/command line if the overall UI language is English. Or the other way around. It's not possible to go with such mixture with partial lines (in case of vertical split), though.\r\n\r\n    In this case you need to switch between \"LTR\" and \"RTL\" as you paint the screen, and back to \"default direction\" when you quit. You also need to disable \"keyboard arrow swapping\" (otherwise you can't tell the key for certain without a race condition) and re-enable it on exit.\r\n\r\n    Again, only do this is the terminal is known to support \"Explicit RTL\" mode.\r\n\r\nIn my BiDi document I somewhat incorrectly claimed that (Neo)Vim don't do BiDi, but do Arabic shaping on the incorrect order of the letters. This has also been quoted here in this thread. I now know that there's a `set rl` which I haven't tried yet. Anyway, about shaping:\r\n\r\nThe currently released v0.1 of the proposal says that shaping needs to be done by Vim et al, using Presentation Form Characters. Based on the feedback I received on the Unicode mailing list, this is going to change for v0.2 (I'll update it as soon as I have time to work on this), and VTE already behaves according to this forthcoming standard.\r\n\r\nAccording to forthcoming BiDi spec v0.2, and VTE's current behavior, Vim and friends should emit the \"regular\" unshaped codepoints (U+06xx and such), shaping is done by the terminal emulator.\r\n",

A config option that fixes Hebrew text rendering in one breaks it in the other, and vice versa (or breaks in both :)). This is not something you want to offer to your users and document. By toggling explicit/implicit mode on startup/exit you should no longer see such differences, VTE's behavior while using neovim should remain the same as it was with older VTE versions (regarding the order of letters; shaping is a different story).\r\n\r\nThis could be followed by refinements for shaping, e.g. altering the default of a corresponding setting. Note that VTE currently replaces the letters by their corresponding Presentation Form Characters internally, and if neovim does this instead (assuming that it does correctly) then it's probably harmless. However, VTE's rendering might be improved one day to an even more beautiful one (or another terminal emulator might implement BiDi with nicer rendering than the presentation form chars), thus using the regular codepoints is recommended.\r\n\r\nOnce these quick fixes are done, there's no need to hurry experimenting with \"explicit RTL\" and evaluating whether nvim wishes to use that mode or not.\r\n",

This is particularly difficult because the problems in the CVE are somewhat tied to language semantics. For instance, Rust's mitigation denies certain BiDi control codepoints within comments and within string literals. So any sort of mitigation would probably have to be tied into the syntax highlighting system, which would need to be enhanced for each syntax to treat certain uses of these characters as errors.",

Bidi must only appear in string variables and comments (and may only modify a full string or comment.)\r\n2. Bidi must never modify other lexems, statements or any bigger structure like function, non-primitive/compositional variables etc.\r\n\r\nNow the question is: Does switching reading from left to right in mid change any of the 2 assertions?\r\nFor checking one needs to compare a file with bidi disabled and a file with bidi enabled in its structural information (a parse),\r\nbecause getting structural information requires a parser.\r\nFrom my point and with the only tool aviable that scales (treesitter) this requires copying the file (to tmp or mmap into memory) and reparse with bidi symbols removed.\r\n\r\nA conservative approach checks what segments of a file are changed due to bidi and checks the 2 parses against another, if\r\nall stuff except string variable definitions and comments has an identical order.\r\nFor string variable definitions or comments a \"all or nothing\" would also be good.\r\n\r\nIs this more clear now?",
