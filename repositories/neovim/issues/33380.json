They render fine in the popup, but it would be nice if they didn't render at all.\n\nHiding them using syntax could be an option but it only hides them, with whitespace remaining. Stripping them would be likely more desirable.\n\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/pull/3374\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen viewing a response from an LSP server (ie. via Hover), the expression of `<!-- .+ -->` is removed from the document.",
