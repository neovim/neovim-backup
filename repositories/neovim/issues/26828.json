This creates an uncomfortable experience when working with multiple buffers.\r\n\r\nThis issue is present in neovim 0.9.4 and the latest nightly release version. It happens when using a custom `init.lua`, with `-u NORC`, and with `-u NONE`. The code mentioned in a [fandom wiki page](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_scrolling_when_switch_buffers) about this issue doesn't seem to work on the latest nightly release. I wrote [some Lua code](https://0x0.st/Hgkc.lua) myself but that doesn't work reliably either. I posted [a thread on the Neovim Discourse forum](https://neovim.discourse.group/t/restore-view-and-position-of-window-when-switching-buffers/) but received no response.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open two buffers in a window with at least as many lines as the maximum number of lines that can displayed at a time in a window\r\n2. Scroll down in the 1st buffer at one of the last lines in a window (say 47th line if 52 lines are being shown in a window at a time)\r\n3. Switch to the 2nd buffer.\r\n4. Switch back to the 1st buffer\r\n5. The `topline` is not preserved and `lnum` position is moved to the middle of the window\r\n6. The same behavior is observed if a custom position is taken in the 2nd buffer.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `topline` value should be preserved and the position of `lnum` in a buffer should be the same where it was left when switching back to it in a window. \r\n\r\nI hope this expected behavior is seen as sensible enough to land a fix in the neovim repository itself rather than fixing it with Lua code although any kind of reliable solution is welcome.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.9.4 and the latest nightly from GitHub\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nbehaves similarly, vim 9.0.2167, the `topline` of only of one the buffers seems to be preserved\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nfoot version 1.16.2 +pgo +ime +graphemes -assertions\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nfoot-extra\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\npacman package manager on Arch Linux, the latest nightly was grabbed from GitHub releases",
