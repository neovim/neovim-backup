Not visible enough\n\nAgree, there is no way we'll realistically notice any breakages on scheduled runs in a timely manner. Vigilance is cringe and doesn't work.\n\n> 2. Hard to track down _what_ broke them when they break.\n\nEh, I think as long as we get some indication in a timely manner that something is off we should be able to fix it relatively easily. \n\n> So I'd suggest running them on (non-draft) PRs; I wouldn't expect them to add a lot of friction (compared to ASAN and TSAN). Rest sounds good to me.\n\nHmm, the CI times are slow as it is, so think we should avoid this if possible.\n\nMy initial thinking is that maybe we could run this on master, but with some indication/notification if something breaks? Some ideas:\n\n- [Create an issue on failure](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/31915#issuecomment-2578487073)\n- Add banner to README (works but kinda ugly)\n- Automatically post a tweet on failure (serenityos posts tweets from their workflow, so can copy their work)",
