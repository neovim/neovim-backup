While playing around i found out that if you have a window with `winfixheight` like for example the quick fix list has by default, if i set `vim.o.laststatus = 3` (or 0 or 1) and start opening and closing terminal windows or even regular windows `new | wincmd J | resize 10`, the height of the quick fix would grow by one on each close / open of the window below the quick fix. Reproduction below. I have no clue why, that would be the case. **It works only if last status is 2, for values 0, 1 and 3 it is not respecting the fixed height**. Note that after enough spam, the qf window will reach max height, at which point it will stop growing, and the top window which had the file explored in it will have something like 2-3 lines of text left in the view.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim -u NONE\r\n\r\n:lua vim.o.laststatus=3\r\n:e somefile.txt\r\n:copen 10 | wincmd J\r\n:new | wincmd J | resize 10 | term\r\n:close\r\n\r\nRepeat the last two commands i.e new followed by close, looking at the qf list window, it starts growing in height (by 1 on each close-open of the window below it)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWindows with fix h and w should not be affected if there is enough space on the screen and the last status value is different than 2. The height should certainly not grow when new windows are opened, it might shrink. \n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWSL2 Ubuntu 22\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\ngithub release",
