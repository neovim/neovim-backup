It is useful because it can quickly give users explanation on what a command does, hence improve discoverity. It can also be used as Command Pallete until Nvim has a Telescope/FZF-like fuzzy finder UI\n\nThis feature is available in qute-browser (a web browser with Vim keymap) and Helix editor\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- The preview window should show `desc` of an user command\n- Built-in Ex commands (that are mentioned in `:h :Ex-commands`) should provide cmdline-completion preview with the same content as `action` column\n- Plugins can define preview/desc for each cmdline completion item (not just desc of each command name but also args, etc)\n\nScreenshot\n\n<table width=\"100%\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"600px\">\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f925cd0-cc64-43b6-80b1-50bfdd8f97a8\" />\n    </td>      \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>\n      Qute browser\n    </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"600px\">\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ee3562-109a-4cae-8a60-192ab964b9c9\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Helix editor</a></th>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n",
