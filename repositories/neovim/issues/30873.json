Running `:Man bash(1)` command in neovim loads the manpage for the older bash version v3.2, which comes builtin on MacOS machines and can be found at `man /usr/share/man/man1/bash.1` (*).\n\n\n---\n\n### Manually loading the bash man page with `:Man /path/to/man/page`:\n\nIf I try to load v3.2 manually `:Man /usr/share/man/man1/bash.1`, then it sais \"No manual entry found for ...\" but I know it exists because it can be loaded manually in the terminal with (*).\n\nAND trying to load v5.2 path manually literally loads v3.2, so it seems that it is impossible to even load version 5.2 with `:Man`.\n\n---\n\nThis behavior manifests in both my full config and also with `nvim --clean`. I asked on matrix and we agreed that since this shows under both the configured and clean it makes sense to post as a bug. I looked at the lua code for `:Man` and conclude that this could maybe be my first patch for neovim but I want to first make sure that this really is a bug and not a feature.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nJust install neovim on macos it seems.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI am expecting man page for bash 5.2 to be loaded with `:Man bash` but I am not sure. \n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-608+g9d74dc3ac AND nvim 0.10\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\n`:Man` is not an editor command in vim\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nMacos 15.0\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.13.2 (bb8ea18)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbob-nvim for latest, and brew for nvim 0.10",
