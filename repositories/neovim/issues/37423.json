    "body": "## Problem\n\nWhen `vim.secure.read()` prompts about an untrusted file (e.g., `.nvim.lua` via `exrc`, or `.lazy.lua` via lazy.nvim), the user must:\n\n1. Choose `(v)iew` to open the file\n2. Ensure they are in the correct buffer\n3. Run `:trust`\n\nThe `:trust` command trusts the **current buffer**, not the file that triggered the prompt. This creates UX friction because:\n\n- Users may accidentally trust the wrong file if they switch buffers\n- The workflow is unnecessarily cumbersome\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n```\nexrc: Found untrusted code. To enable it, choose (v)iew then run `:trust`:\n/path/to/.nvim.lua\n(i)gnore, (v)iew, (d)eny:\n```\n\nAfter choosing `(v)iew`:\n- The file opens in a split\n- User must manually verify they're in the correct buffer\n- `:trust` only works on the current buffer\n\nIf the user runs `:trust` in the wrong buffer (e.g., the original file they were editing), they trust the wrong file.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nOption A: `:trust` should trust the file that triggered the prompt, regardless of current buffer.\n\nOption B: Allow `:trust /path/to/file` syntax for `allow` action, so users can explicitly specify which file to trust.\n\nCurrently, `vim.secure.trust({action=\"allow\", path=...})` throws an error:\n```lua\nassert(not path, '\"path\" is not valid when action is \"allow\"')\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nIn [Discussion #27627](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/27627), it was mentioned that trusting non-current files is not allowed for security reasons (e.g., a malicious process may change content while typing the command).\n\nI'd like to offer some thoughts on this:\n\n1. **Hash-based trust already provides protection**: The trust database stores SHA256 hashes. If a file is modified after trusting, the hash won't match on next load, and Neovim will prompt again.\n\n2. **Allowing path specification could be equally safe**: The hash would still be computed at the moment of trust, providing the same protection as the current buffer-based approach.\n\n3. **Current UX risk**: Users may accidentally trust the wrong file by running `:trust` in the wrong buffer, which could be a greater practical risk.\n\n4. **API consistency**: `vim.secure.trust({action=\"deny\", path=...})` allows specifying a path. Allowing the same for `allow` would make the API more consistent.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Enable `exrc` or use lazy.nvim with `local_spec = true`\n2. Create a `.nvim.lua` or `.lazy.lua` file in a project directory\n3. Open Neovim in that directory\n4. When prompted, choose `(v)iew`\n5. Switch to a different buffer (e.g., `:b#`)\n6. Run `:trust`\n7. **Result**: The wrong file is trusted\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModify `vim/secure.lua` to:\n\n1. Remove the restriction on `path` parameter for `allow` action\n2. Or, store the \"pending trust\" file path when the prompt is shown, and have `:trust` (without arguments) trust that file\n\n```lua\n-- Current:\nif action == 'allow' then\n    assert(not path, '\"path\" is not valid when action is \"allow\"')\nend\n\n-- Proposed:\n-- Remove this assertion, allow path for all actions\n```\n\n## Environment\n\n- Neovim version: 0.10+\n- OS: Linux/macOS/Windows (affects all platforms)\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #21092 - Original `:trust` command proposal (suggested `:trust allow /path/to/file` syntax)\n- #27686 - \"A less black-boxy vim.secure\" (closed as NOT_PLANNED)\n- Discussion #27627 - \"How to use `:trust`?\"",

But don't need to debate that.\n\n> Option A: `:trust` should trust the file that triggered the prompt, regardless of current buffer.\n\nThis is unwise because it requires the user to remember stuff. Multiple trust prompts could happen.\n\n> Option B: Allow `:trust /path/to/file` syntax for `allow` action, so users can explicitly specify which file to trust.\n> \n> Currently, `vim.secure.trust({action=\"allow\", path=...})` throws an error:\n> \n> assert(not path, '\"path\" is not valid when action is \"allow\"')\n\nI don't think we explicitly decided against `:trust /path/to/file` or `vim.secure.trust({action=\"allow\", path=...})` . So allowing that seems fine. cc @gpanders to confirm.",
