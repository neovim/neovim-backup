As far as I can tell, GUI implementations have a fair bit of free reign in the format of the `guifont` setting. For example, neovide extends it to include height. This current issue may therefore benefit from neovim defining a format for font specifications, including things like height and width, for GUIs and highlight schemes to follow. Perhaps OSC 50 as a guide? Unsure how extensive that is.",
