It would be nice if the window IDs were passed in the callback argument table.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- It's sort of done in `WinClosed`, with the ID of the window to be closed being passed in as a string in `ev.file` and `ev.match`. I'm not sure why it does this, perhaps an oversight when they were originally implemented in vim?\r\n\r\n- `WinClosed` doesn't pass the ID at all.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason this isn't already a thing? Am I misunderstanding the use of the callback argument?\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWindow ID of window to be opened/closed should be passed as an integer in the callback event argument table.\r\nI found the documentation quite unclear on this, but I believe it should be passed as an integer in `ev.data`. This shouldn't break backwards compatibility, as this would simply be an addition to the current argument table.",

Consider the following:\r\n> \r\n> ```vim\r\n> nvim --clean\r\n> :edit a\r\n> :rightbelow vsplit b\r\n> :wincmd w\r\n> :autocmd ColorScheme * wincmd w\r\n> :autocmd ColorScheme * echomsg 'win='..winnr() 'buf='..expand('<afile>')\r\n> :colorscheme blue\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Even though the event triggered in window 1, the 2nd autocmd prints `win=2 buf=a`, it has no way of knowing the original window (but `<afile>` gives it the original buffer).\r\n\r\nSimilar to `<abuf>`, it seems to me that passing the \"window at trigger-time\" is useful for any event, not only `Win*` events, because autocmds can change windows.",
