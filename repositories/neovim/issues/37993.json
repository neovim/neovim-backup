    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen you use neovim as your git commit editor, and you have status enabled, and you try to input a lot of commands that will refresh your view fast, (for me, Ctrl + D), there is a lot of lag. \n\nThis is not related to the number of lines in your buffer, or in status, or the contents of the diff. It is gitcommit for long filenames specifically and nothing else. \n\nI believe this is some kind of regex blowup.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\nCreate an empty git repository\n\nCopy paste this into terminal\n```\np=\nfor i in {1..30}; do p+=\"${p:+/}spam$i\"; done\nmkdir -p \"$p\"\nfor i in {1..64}; do : > \"$p/file$i.txt\"; done\n```\n\n(excessive, but to prove the point. This can be triggered off of much simpler and naturaler patterns - ran into this issue at work)\n\n```\ngit add .\ntouch init.lua\nGIT_EDITOR='nvim -u init.lua' git commit \n```\n\n(make sure you have no after plugins etc; I have a shell script to install neovim so I just deleted ~/.config/nvim to be 100% sure it's not my issue) \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo lag.\n\nI tried writing to after/ftplugin/gitcommit.lua:\n\n```\nlocal buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()\nvim.bo[buf].syntax = \"OFF\"\n```\nand by enabling gitcommit and diff, this solved the issue. \n\n^^^ I figured that out 10 mintues after submitting my bug report. Oops.\n\nOf course, even if this *is* correct, this is a hackaround, but I will let the maintainers decide if this is a priority. The issue is definitely the regexes in syntax/gitcommit.vim\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.12.0-dev-f8d59cf\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nVIM - Vi IMproved 9.2 (2026 Feb 14, compiled Feb 16 2026 19:44:28)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux 2026-02-01 version\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.16.1 (42f49eeb)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color, xterm-256color (tried both)\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom nightly source",
