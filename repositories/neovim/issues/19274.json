I tend to use `[d`, `]d` to navigate around my diagnostics, and `[s`, `]s` (from `vim-unimpaired`) to navigate around my misspellings. It occurred to me, then, that really misspellings are just a special case of diagnostics. It would be really interesting if NeoVim were to treat misspellings as diagnostic entries, presumably in a 'spelling' namespace - enabling us to treat them in a common way. There might be some breaking changes around the fringes, but if the existing spell keybindings continued to work with that \"in-built diagnostic provider\" too much backwards-breaking-change could be avoided.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this is not a trivial refactoring, but I would be interested to know if other folks would see the value.",
