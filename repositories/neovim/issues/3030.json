    "body": "I'm attempting to run a GNU Make instance with termopen, and I'm seeing messages being dropped. I'm hooking into the on_exit() callback to write the terminal buffer to an external log, as well as parse it for errors for the quickfix list.\n\nI deliberately added a compile error so that Make would error-out. When this happens, GCC prints to stderr, make exits, and my messages show up on the terminal. When I look at test.log, however, the last few lines are just _gone._\n\nRather than sharing the repository, I've managed to find a minimal case that results in lost data, namely by throwing lots of text at the terminal. I don't know if this is the same problem as the make issue, but with this test case, I get about 700 lines of \"stdout,\" when I am expecting 2000.\n\nI poked into it a bit and my guess is that data is being dropped somewhere after SIGCHLD is sent but there is still data either to be read in the TTY fds, or its already been sucked out of the fd but it makes it to the terminal buffer after the process has already exited and the exit callback has been called.\n\nI've attached a minimal test case that fails on my computer as of \n5e9f9a875645af1e3c858daba799fe4a9021a767\n\nAm I doing something stupid?\n\n```\nlet s:Output = {}\n\nfunction! s:Output.on_exit(id, code)\n    write! test.log\nendfunction\n\nfunction! s:termtest()\n    only\n    vert botright sp | enew\n    let s:Output['bufid'] = bufnr('%')\n    call termopen([&sh, &shcf, './test.sh'], s:Output)\nendfunction\n\ncommand! -nargs=0 Termtest call s:termtest()\n```\n\nEDIT (@mhinz: shortened 2000 lines of code to two loops, as suggested by @lucc):\n\n``` shell\n#!/bin/sh\nfor i in {0..1000}; do echo \"stdout $i\"; done\nfor i in {0..1000}; do echo \"stderr $i\" 1>&2; done\n```\n",

I can see EOF being sent in the libuv read_cb(), and looking at the byte counts it looks like EOF comes before all of the output has been pulled out of the fd. If I add a simple sleep 1 at the end of my script, everything turns out fine.\n\nRunning nvim in strace also seems to slow down the read_cb() calls enough that all the output is successfully received.\n\nMaybe the shell itself is not flushing its output, or it closes its file descriptors without flushing output to the ptr, or maybe termios is doing something weird? I don't know enough about how the job system and libvte are put together to know how all the pipes and fds are plumbed together.

Here's a high-level overview of how it works:\n> - Nvim receives data from the pty\n> - Data is fed to libvterm, which immediately updates its internal screen\n> - At most 10ms later, nvim updates the terminal buffer to reflect libvterm internal screen.\n> \n> In other words, nvim updates the buffer at most once each 10 milliseconds. This is done because updating buffers is more expensive than simply updating a virtual screen, and if we updated the buffer every time data is received, there could be serious performance problems with programs that send large bursts of output\n",

It's quite a pesky issue because if for example you are running a compiler, it normally means the error text is being cut from the end of the output.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce the exact case from the comment above this.\r\n\r\nHere's some extra information for if someone takes a look.\r\n- I'm using Linux Fedora, with neovim built from source at b649a96fc09fa7f18a988b0b0be5dadb54ad49de.\r\n- I'm calling `vim.fn.termopen()`. The issue persists regardless of whether the I pass the command as a string or a list (docs say results in jobstart running in a shell or not).\r\n- Issue is not there if I open a terminal buffer with `:terminal` and run the command there.\r\n- Seems to work fine on Mac.\r\n- If the command only outputs a small amount of text to stdout, this problem is not present. It seems to happen when there is a lot of text being passed to stdout and then the application abruptly ends. When it does happen, it happens every time.\r\n\r\nEDIT: for those looking for a workaround, I have found that wrapping the command like before you call termopen() helps: `sh -c \"<command> ; sleep 1\"`\r\n\r\n",
