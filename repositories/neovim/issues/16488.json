    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\n\nNo\n\n### Feature description\n\n#13854 adds support for general-purpose fuzzy filtering of completion candidates, but I've been recently thinking about ways to make this more general, and allow plugins to have more control over the completion process beyond just filtering. More specifically, I'm proposing an API such as the following:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.api.nvim_completion_attach(mode, {\r\n  on_init = function(line, index)\r\n    -- returns the index where completion should start, like omnifunc\r\n  end,\r\n  on_fetch = function(prefix)\r\n    -- returns a list of completion candidates, overriding the current completion list.\r\n  end,\r\n  on_fetch_chain = function(prefix)\r\n    -- returns a list of completion candidates, which are then appended to the current completion list.\r\n  end\r\n  on_filter = function(prefix, match)\r\n    -- returns a float representing the match between prefix and match.\r\n    -- higher numbers are sorted first in the completion list.\r\n  end,\r\n  on_select = function(match)\r\n    -- called when a completion candidate is selected.\r\n  end,\r\n  on_accept = function(match)\r\n    -- called when a completion candidate is accepted.\r\n  end,\r\n  on_cancel = function() end,\r\n})\r\n```\r\nwhere `mode` is one of the builtin completion modes, such as `CTRL_X_{NORMAL, FILES, TAGS}`, etc.\r\n\r\nAs follow up work, we can also allow for custom user completion modes via a new api function `nvim_complete`, which is also implemented in #13854:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvim.api.nvim_completion_attach(\"user:git\", ...)\r\nvim.api.nvim_complete(1, {\"git\", \"files\", \"here\"}, {completion_mode = \"git\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm posting this issue to try and get feedback on whether this is even a good idea or not, and general API design, before I start writing anything.",

Avoiding the strict API contract while experimenting. I'm not 💯 on the internals but I'd imagine serializing completion candidates to Lua objects directly instead of going the API Objects route could speed things up and perhaps simpler to implement?",

Chaining completion sources would be done via the `on_fetch_chain` key: the idea is that multiple plugins could attach a completion source to a particular mode so that triggering completion will fetch candidates from all of the attached sources.\r\n\r\n> How would this interact with the existing autocmds CompleteDone, CompleteDonePre and CompleteChanged, what's the advantage of on_select, on_accept ... over the existing autocmd system?\r\n\r\nThe autocommands do not allow direct control over the internal completion mechanisms used by vim. Adding a `CompleteFetch` or `CompleteFilter` autocommand is not enough, since plugins might actually need to modify the completion list themselves, or override default filtering behavior. I do agree that maybe `on_accept` seems mostly redundant with `CompleteDone`, but I think the main benefit of the proposal is the ability to distinguish different types of completion, i.e. running different code when finishing files completion versus tags completion, versus some special user defined completion mode. Doing something like that just via autocommands alone is difficult and clunky.",
