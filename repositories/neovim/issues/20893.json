Is it the having to open a text file and add `\"user/repo\"` or `.setup()`? I think it might be hard for current package managers to have a standard `yarn add`-ish command, since unlike e.g. `package.json` they're very unopinionated about how your package list can be written - you can put them anywhere. Maybe one could end up with something like the bash/zsh world where install commands just append lines, but that's not great.\r\n\r\n3. Is it the lack of a graphical config editor like VSCode? That works only with JSON config I think. But maybe a convenience function like \":configure <plugin_name>\" to open the relevant config section would be a nice touch. For the same reasons as point 2, this seems challenging for current package managers.\r\n\r\n4. Is it the discoverability of it all? Maybe just put a section about plugins in the `:Tutor` and call out `:Tutor` in the default startup screen?\r\n\r\nThe only one that seems plausible to me is 4. That said, I understand \"UX obsession\", though that starts with understanding the problem / user story deeply first.\r\n\r\nIs \"funnel users into a good package manager as efficiently as possible\" an acceptable substitute for \"actually have a package manager built in\"?",

New users must look for a plugin manager and figure out how to install it.\n    - Nvim documentation should be able to give a one-liner to install (non-builtin) plugin managers and plugins.\n2. Lack of a _declarative_ way to specify plugins.\n    - Lets Nvim reason about dependency ordering / transitivity.\n    - Lets crawlers build a [package index](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/24221).\n    - [packspec](https://github.com/neovim/packspec/) adds potential to leverage NPM tooling (and possibly infrastructure).\n\n# Goals\n\nThese problems are in-scope (everything else is out of scope):\n\n1. ✅ ([#34009](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34009)) Include a _minimal_ builtin plugin manager.\n    - Users shouldn't need to look for a plugin manager online and install it.\n    - Users can easily install _another plugin manager_ with a one-liner.\n1. ✅ Must be _minimal_. One file, 500-1000 lines of code.\n    - If users want advanced features they must install an advanced plugin manager.\n1. Supports packspec (**declarative way** to fetch plugins) + hooks.\n    - Need to finish the packspec story... https://github.com/neovim/packspec/\n    - Define a convention for _hooks_:\n        - post-install: one-time, just after a plugin is installed.\n        - pre-activate: per-session, just before a plugin is loaded/required.\n        - post-activate\n1. [NEEDS DISCUSSION] \"Provider\" model: other plugin managers can [provide](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#dev-provider) plugin management (`:packinstall`, `vim.plugins()`, etc/whatever).\n1. Future goals (not required for initial implementation):\n    1. Nvim should be able to list plugins from a [plugin index](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/24221#issuecomment-1616009906) like https://dotfyle.com/neovim/plugins/trending or whatever. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/24221\n\n## Counterpoints\n\n- This could discourage the use of https://luarocks.org/ which is an actual, real package manager.\n\n# Proposal\n\n- Probably _shouldn't_ use pack/start, just use plain old 'rtp' (based on feedback from folke/lewis; needs discussion).\n    - Reference: https://github.com/lewis6991/pckr.nvim/blob/main/lua%2Fpckr%2Floader.lua contains all of the logic that improves upon `pack` and specifically `start`.\n- Use `curl` or `vim.fetch()` (which uses `curl`). This doesn't need to be perfect initially, we just need a way of downloading a file.\n- Requires `git`.\n- Inline https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim or [mini.deps](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-deps.md), clean it up, fix some parts of it.\n    - mini.deps vs paq: https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/6a1a44220b3b9ee9856059686fd47b15c8ed83db/doc/mini-deps.txt#L75-L79\n- Introduce something like `:packinstall`.\n    - It is handled by the default plugin manager.
