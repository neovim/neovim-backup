    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim's built-in formatter feature (`gw` and `gq` maps) incorrectly indent's markdown list items when some line starts with one of keyword like `if`, `for`, `while` (maybe more others). This happens only with enabled option 'smartindent'. For details see \"Steps to reproduce\".\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate file `a.md` (markdown extension important) with content:\n```\n* buggy items:\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  if aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  for aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  while aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\n* example of good (ordinary) indent:\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  bb aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n```\n\nRun nvim with 'smartindent' option set and format whole file:\n```\nnvim --clean a.md +set\\ smartindent\ngwG\n```\n\nAfter format you have such wrong indented items:\n```\n* buggy items:\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  if aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n      aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n      aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  for aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n      aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n      aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  while aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n      aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n      aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\n* example of good (ordinary) indent:\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  bb aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFormatted file should look like:\n```\n* buggy items:\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  if aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  for aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  while aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\n* example of good (ordinary) indent:\n* aaaa aaa aa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aa aaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aa aaaaa\n  bb aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaa\n  aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa\n  aaaaaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n```\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.3\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, buggy too. vim 9.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\narchlinux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nst 0.9.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nst-256color\n\n### Installation\n\narch pacman",

If you turn it on in Markdown files, Neovim will dutifully attempt to indent them like C files. This isn't a bug, it's a usage error.\n\nIf I were to propose a change here, it would be to add a big fat warning to the top of the documentation, because the name of this option is catnip for anyone with indentation problems.

This was just someone attempting to scratch an itch and almost immediately giving up. That said, I would not fully dismiss the idea of a better-than-nothing indentation plugin for Markdown.",

So, I rephrase my question to @tpope :\n\"May it be useful to add a minimal indent definition to [vim-markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown) with `setlocal nosmartindent`? Allowing for users to keep their global `smartindent` setting, yet overridden when editing markdown.\"\n(If yes, I'm still good to volunteer :-) )\n\n(I also take the chance to clarify, just to avoid confusion: bringing attention to 11 years old attempt for markdown indent was rather express that the idea seem to have been around before. No attempt to use or integrate outdated code. Of course not even to use such solution if the idea is evaluated as inconvenient.)",

It's not even documented as a \"global or local\" option, it's just \"local to buffer\". Vim does let you shoot yourself in the foot here, but that's hardly the only instance of that.",
