    "body": "### Problem\n\nSeveral early issues were opened against Neovim relating to the removal of Vim's `t_xx` commands, which allowed users to override unwanted UI behavior, in particular the \"alternate screen\" usage that makes on-screen information vanish into the ether on quit or suspend: #3432 #4381 It seems that the advice on those tickets was that it wasn't the job of Neovim to provide a mechanism to disable this functionality because if people wanted to turn off \"alternate screen\" then they could just compile a personalized terminfo with `smcup` and `rmcup` capabilities disabled.\n\nUnfortunately this workaround does not work on Windows, because as per #26221, unibilium has a bug in that it opens compiled terminfo files without the `O_BINARY` flag, which means they cannot be parsed and then the Neovim TUI falls back on built-in definitions anyway. Although there is a change proposed for unibilium which would fix this bug, the ticket was closed as WONTFIX because unibilium is apparently being deprecated.\n\nThis means there is no way for Windows users to get classic vi behavior where quitting the application leaves the text on-screen unless they switch their TERM to `linux` or `ansi`, which they would only know to do if they read through `terminfo_builtin.h`. Once unibilium is removed from build altogether, then this issue will start to affect users on WSL, Linux and other platforms too.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf the end goal is to move away from externally-provided terminfo and just use a controlled set of built-ins, then I think perhaps the idea of providing some alternative to the `t_xx` settings should be revisited. At least I think it would be useful to consider adding functionality to disable \"alternate screen\". This is particularly relevant for usage as EDITOR/VISUAL in a command-line workflow where it can be helpful to scroll back up to see previously-edited files, or when suspending the editor with ^Z to do something while referencing the text you were just editing (unfortunately also not working on Windows, but that's a separate issue: #6660).",
