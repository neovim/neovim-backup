My issue about whether or not there is a plan about vim's `b:undo_ftplugin` feature. As far as I know currently there is no way to control it with Lua without setting the variable itself with Vimscript string. It would be nice to have a callback function option like keymap module.",

No plans to duplicate it in Lua. And it's not clear why you can't set it with e.g. `vim.bo`.",
