(This code will be changed, but this still seems to be a neovim issue.)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n`nvim --clean`\r\n\r\n`:lua vim.api.nvim_buf_call(0, function() return {a = function() return 'x' end} end)`\r\n\r\ngives the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nE5108: Error executing lua [string \":lua\"]:1: Cannot convert given lua type\r\nstack traceback:\r\n\t[C]: in function 'nvim_buf_call'\r\n\t[string \":lua\"]:1: in main chunk\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWe should be able to return a table containing function values, so it should behave more like the following, which doesn't cause an error:\r\n\r\n`nvim --clean`\r\n\r\n`:lua vim.api.nvim_buf_call(0, function() return {a = 'x'} end)`\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-1721+g01b91deec-Homebrew\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 14.1.1\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nwezterm 20231030-074559-75909682\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nwezterm\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nhomebrew",

But other than that, I guess there isn't too much we can do.\r\n\r\nYes, a fundamental limitation.\r\n\r\nThe API can either be used:\r\n- Directly from Lua natively within Nvim\r\n- Over RPC for remote plugins which can be written in any language. This requires encoding the values into a text format. Such format cannot encode function values.\r\n\r\nNote when used from Lua in Nvim, msgpack isn't actually used, but the underlying framework around the API is built around msgpack compatible types. The only exception is that we allow inputs to be function values in some cases.",
