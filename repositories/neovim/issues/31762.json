In such a case it may be preferred to not have the language server active at all, as their presence is more distracting than helpful.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`vim.lsp.enable()` could be made to respect a new flag in `vim.lsp.Config` that works similarly to `single_file_support` from `nvim-lspconfig`. This flag would tell `vim.lsp.enable()` to only launch the language server when one of the `root_markers` specified in `vim.lsp.Config` is found. ",

I thought the root dir is found by root markers.
