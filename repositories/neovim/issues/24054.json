Then you could still disable the functionality with `<option> = false`, or enable it with its defaults with `<option> = true`, but also have more granular control if needed. For example `semantic_tokens = { debounce = 500 }`\r\n\r\nAlthough this would still only address the \"per client\" (static) configuration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRegarding vim.lsp.config:\r\n\r\n> should we adopt workspaceFolder instead of \"root markers\"\r\n\r\nI think this is a bit of a red herring. We've `lsp.start` and `lsp.start_client` both which support setting workspaceFolders. To use more than one workspaceFolders you always need some heuristic to make that decision and you need to know that the language server actually supports it in a meaningful way (many don't). So imho this is out of scope for core, and unrelated to having a global configuration skeleton. (What we could do is extend `vim.lsp.start` to automatically extend the workspaceFolders if `reuse_client` returns true, to make it easier to use)\r\n\r\nI think if we do a `vim.lsp.config`, it should act as a template/skeleton for `vim.lsp.start`  - basically take care of the \"global\" part, while the `config` argument of `vim.lsp.start` takes care of the per-client settings.",
