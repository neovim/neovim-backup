    "body": "In terminal mode, users often have a choice of setting up the terminal emulator to display the current cursor position via a caret (`|`), an underline (`_`), or a block (`â–ˆ`), each with its own tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nThe caret and underscore are the least obstructive (i.e. one can clearly make out what character is under them) but are also very hard to visually spot when the cursor moves to an unknown location (search for a symbol and then spend 10 seconds playing with the arrow keys trying to obtain a visual indication of where the cursor wound up after the jump). The block is easy to spot, but obscures the character under the block (did I already type `}` and navigate backwards or did I not?). Setting up the terminal to blink the cursor block helps tremendously, but one must still wait for the block to blink before being able to \r\n\r\nRecently while using [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis), I saw a different approach that doesn't require (as far as I can tell) cooperation from the terminal emulator to pull off. The actual cursor is hidden, and instead the block corresponding to where the cursor should be is rendered in reverse/negative. This is perhaps best illustrated with screenshots:\r\n\r\n**Underline mode**\r\n\r\nCan you find the cursor?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/606923/32418063-6787d3fa-c228-11e7-82c8-87fe84481a24.png)\r\n\r\n**Block mode**\r\n\r\nDo you think you can see everything in the buffer in the screenshot below?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/606923/32417996-9abadbd8-c227-11e7-9948-07adbeebcf03.png)\r\n\r\n... because this is what you see when the cursor blinks:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/606923/32418027-01eea5f0-c228-11e7-88d5-c542961d58dc.png)\r\n\r\n**Inverted Block**\r\n\r\nHow vis solves the problem\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/606923/32417999-a6534052-c227-11e7-8a33-b3c9e023dc85.png)\r\n\r\nIn vis, the cursor does not blink, but that can also be easily implemented with a timer that alternates between inverse and actual colors for the cursor position.\r\n\r\nI think this is a tremendous usability gain and would urge consideration of adopting this feature.",

More specifically, the iTerm2 has the feature to automatically reverse the font color under the box cursor such that one can spot the character at the cursor's position. I've used other modern TE programs like those in Gnome and KDE, but never notice any color issue with the box cursor. So I guess this is only an issue affecting Windows users? Or is there any setting in the Windows cmd.exe program that can be turned on?",
