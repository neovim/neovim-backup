I stepped away from C# for a few weeks, and when I returned I was unable to open `.cs` files without neovim freaking out:\n```\nError executing callback:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n...nvim-linux-x86_64/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua:195: cannot resume dead coroutine                                                                                                                                                                                     \nstack traceback:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n        [C]: in function 'parse_chunk'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n        ...nvim-linux-x86_64/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua:195: in function 'handler'                                                                                                                                                                                    \n        ...nvim-linux-x86_64/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/_system.lua:172: in function <...nvim-linux-x86_64/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/_system.lua:171>\n```\nI would hit enter, and the error message would just reappear, again and again. It wouldn't actually let me edit the file as I couldn't get past it. I disabled `omnisharp_mono` and the issue went away. So, I thought that was the culprit. Except, Omnisharp hasn't had an update since Dec. 2024, which is before the problem started. So I decided to mess with my LSP config. I stripped all my Omnisharp customization and configuration away until the only thing I was essentially `ensure_installed = { 'omnisharp_mono' }`, but still no cigar.\n\nI use the nightly build of neovim, and keep it up-to-date (update it roughly once a week?). My final troubleshooting step was to revert back to the latest stable neovim release (v0.11.0). Lo-and-behold, it fixed my issue. I've been running fine on stable ever since, even with all my customization/configs.\n\nI have the latest versions of all packages/language servers, as well as the latest version of Mono installed on my system.\nI don't know enough to say what caused it; but some change between the stable release and the nightly build broke my LSP.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen a `.cs` file with the `omnisharp_mono` LSP installed on the latest nightly build. Observe errors.\nThen, using the exact same LSP setup/config, switch to the stable release, open the same file, and see no errors.\n\nI was able to reproduce it with a blank lspconfig that basically only had `ensure_installed = { 'omnisharp_mono' }` in the Mason section, but if it helps, [here is my current lspconfig](https://github.com/Zman350x/nvim-config/blob/main/lua/zman/plugins/lsp/lspconfig.lua).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAble to open/edit a `.cs` file without issue, and with a working LSP.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.12.0-dev-178+gd3cded796c\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nKDE Neon 6.3\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkonsole 25.04.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nother, extracting the `.tag.gz` (either nightly or release) into my `/usr/local/bin`",
