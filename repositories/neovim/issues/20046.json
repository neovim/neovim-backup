    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\n\nNo\n\n### Feature description\n\nThe `matchadd()` function (and related functions / commands) is scoped to windows rather than to buffers. This usually makes little sense - if the buffer changes in the window, the matches are quite likely to be nonsensical. Many suggestions on the internet try to work around this problem, but they usually have a variety of oversights / shortcomings, e.g., ones that suggest using BufWinEnter but don't account for the fact that it's not triggered on a window split. Developing a setup that reliably adds the highlight for all windows with the buffer and reliably removes it when the buffer changes is quite difficult, and requires modeling the auto-commands as a state machine that accounts for different sorts of scenarios. Having `matchadd()` (and related functions / commands) that can operate on a buffer instead of on a window would make this a lot simpler.",
