    "body": "### Problem\n\nI have a basic Clangd LSP setup. Sometimes, I want to copy the type of a specific symbol. To do so, I set the cursor on that symbol an press `<S-k>k`, so now the cursor is in the floating documentation window.\nWhen I go all the way down in the line that contains the type, I try moving to the next word with `w`, but the cursor gets stuck in specifically the 3rd column of than line. further `w` presses do no do anything, the cursor does not move anymore, whereas it should just jump to the next word so I can yank what I need.\n\nThe only way to unstuck it is to go up with `k`, then move a couple of columns, then down again to the line I need.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHere an example with a screenshot.\nSay I want to copy the text `OS *get_singleton()`.\nI go down to `public`, and press `w`.\nI'm expecting the cursor to jump to the `s` in `static`, but it actually it only jumps to the `b` of `public` (the 3rd column), and pressing `w` again a bunch of times does not do anything. So I have to go up to the previous line then back down so that the cursor is unstuck\n\n<img width=\"592\" height=\"262\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f85b4f4-e492-4c07-b12a-4218be893669\" />\n\nThis only happens specifically on that last line. The other lines in that same floating window do not cause the same problem, and using `w` jumps correctly to the next words.\n\n[Edit] Adding a minimal reproduction project on Linux\nI wasn't able to upload one with the clangd binary included in the zip file, it was too big, so Github rejected it. So clangd needs to be downloaded\n\n[minimal.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23499078/minimal.zip)\n\nTo run it : \n```\nwget https://github.com/clangd/clangd/releases/download/21.1.0/clangd-linux-21.1.0.zip\nunzip clangd-linux-21.1.0.zip clangd_21.1.0/bin/clangd\nnvim --clean -u minimal.lua main.cpp\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPressing `w` in that specific line should just jump to the next word as usual.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI don't really know, this seems specific to that floating neovim window with  LSP data\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nKonsole\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nPrebuilt binary downloaded from Github",
