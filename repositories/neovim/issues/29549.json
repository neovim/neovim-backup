I realize this is a huge ask as it's changing diff mode to a single window from multiple ones but it would be amazing if such a feature was available.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/1597820/987fa50a-3aaf-4c7c-b078-df3a174e0bff)\r\n\r\nthis screenshot from lazygit, using git word-diff=color mode shows clearly that the `async` keyword has been removed\r\n\r\ncompared to this\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/1597820/3d900332-1e40-42d9-8f82-f8be72f0d970)\r\n\r\nwhich had me look through the string for differences before I opened up lazygit to see what the actual difference was.\r\n\r\nI find myself constantly switching between the two programs in different terminal windows to review diffs, I'd prefer to just stay in neovim.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSome sort of option that enables word-diff mode, puts the diffs in the same window instead of side by side buffers.",
