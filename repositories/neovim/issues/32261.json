    "body": "### Problem\n\nThere are a number of plugins out there that are mapping things to the most common shortcuts, like `<CR>`, `<Tab>`, etc.\nAdding that kind of mapping to your own plugin or configuration, and have it work well with other plugins that do the same, is very complicated.\nFor example, we can see [this crazy workaround](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/blob/main/lua/cmp/utils/keymap.lua) that nvim-cmp uses to be able to map these things. \n\nThere is same issue created a decade ago that got postponed due to other things being a priority: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/159\n\nI tried searching something similar on Vim repo, but no luck.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIdeally, this would be something that would work for both Vim and Neovim, but that's probably not possible because of Vimscript and some other factors, so having a Neovim only solution would probably be sufficient for the most part.\n\nMy idea is to have a built-in function that looks something like this:\n```lua\n-- for example nvim-cmp adds this:\nvim.keymap.append('i', '<CR>', function()\n  if cmp.visible() then\n    -- Select the item and insert it, but do not add a line\n    cmp.accept()\n  end\n\n  -- Continue the chain\n  return true\nend, { priority = 2 })\n\n-- some autopairs plugin:\nvim.keymap.append('i', '<CR>', function()\n  if autopairs.should_expand() then\n    -- Do expanding logic\n    -- return false to stop the chain, since expanding logic already added a new line\n    return false\n  end\n\n  return true\nend, { priority = 3 })\n```\n\nBriefly:\n1. Mapping uses an `append` method on `vim.keymap` (`append` name is just an example)\n2. If it returns `true`, it means that the chain can continue\n3. If it returns `false`, mappings with lower priority are not executed, chain stops\n4. If none of the entries in the chain returns false, do the default mapping\n\nImplementation wise, it would be something like this (very simplified):\n1. First call to `append` creates a mapping for that mode+shortcut+buffer/global, and sets up a chain with that one callback\n2. Every other `append` with the same mode+shortcut+buffer/global just adds the new callback to the chain\n\nThere are a few of things that are not handled with this approach, like:\n1. Compatibility with Vim\n2. Handling `expr` mappings\n3. Handling non-callback mappings\n4. Buffer scoped/global mappings\n5. Same priority entries\n6. Possible duplicate entries, in case the code that adds the mapping is sourced multiple times\n\nAnd some of the possible workarounds for these:\n2. If having an `expr` mapping is needed, plugin creator (or whoever needs it) should handle that with `feedkeys` or however it suits them.\n    Or have the non-boolean value returned considered a `false`, where expr would be evaluated and chain would stop\n4. Probably just leave them separate as it is now and have buffer mapping have a priority over global mapping\n5. Throw an error if this happens, or show a warning and push the same entry one priority level below\n6. Allow setting an `id` for the mapping to prevent this\n\n\nAt this point, Neovim plugin ecosystem is big enough to have most of the vimscript plugins ported to Lua, so conflicts and forced overrides as we have them now could be resolved.\n\nIf this is something that Neovim team would agree to add to the core, I could start working on a PR.",

So I don't see any other way it could work :) Happy to hear other ideas though.\n\nThat will work, just wanted to confirm that I understood it. It might create some overhead for certain situations to figure out the context, but it's an improvement nonetheless.\n\nBesides my initial suggestion, which is drastically simpler but less robust, I don't have any other idea.\n\nSince this feature is much more complex, I'll have to leave it to someone else. I'm not familiar with the lower level code, and my C skills are subpar.\n",
