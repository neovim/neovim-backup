This is useful, for example, in the following cases:\r\n- Set mapping to be active only when snippet session is active.\r\n- Create autocommand to be active only when snippet session is active. Like to stop snippet session when exiting to `Normal` mode by using `ModeChanged` event (created on `SnippetEnter`, deleted on `SnippetLeave`).\r\n\r\nBoth these use cases *can* be worked around by having `if vim.snippet.active()` check inside of them, but it seems very wasteful to have mapping/autocommand all the time when it is only needed during active snippet session.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`SnippetEnter` and `SnippetLeave` `User` events which trigger when snippet session starts and ends. Ideally, with some snippet parsing data parsed in `data` of autocommand's callback.",

            "body": "> > What I actually want (right now) is a clean way to implement \"stop snippet session after exit to Normal mode\" behavior.\r\n> \r\n> To add for completeness sake, the current workarounds for that concrete use-case:\r\n> \r\n> a) Override all keys that switch to normal mode, to call snippet.exit, e.g.:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> keymap.set({'i', 's'}, '<ESC>', function()\r\n>   if vim.snippet then\r\n>     vim.snippet.exit()\r\n>   end\r\n>   return '<ESC>'\r\n> end, { expr = true })\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> b) Call `vim.snippet.exit()` in a `ModeChanged` event.\r\n\r\nAfter actually trying to use `ModeChanged` event, it doesn't really work in all cases. It can get triggered when navigating through tabstops with non empty text (either previously entered one and going back to it, or a tabstop with placeholder). This seems to be because tabstop selection itself exits to Normal mode: [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/b2d471ab337e56f660eb7c89ae24f447f7b7a165/runtime/lua/vim/snippet.lua#L279) and [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/b2d471ab337e56f660eb7c89ae24f447f7b7a165/runtime/lua/vim/snippet.lua#L289).\r\n\r\nSo under current implementation I don't \"stop snippet session if user exited to Normal mode\" is possible with autocommand. Using a global remap for `<Esc>` is not really an option in the case of a general plugin (which relies on `vim.snippet` functionality). Making that remap being local and only during snippet session is rather painful but acceptable.",

Of course, without _any_ other cancellation logic, it would be on us to make sure that is reachable. I think having a bit more, permissive, logic by default would be reasonable (i.e., erring on the side of staying in snippet mode too long) and punting the rest to user customization...\r\n\r\n...which brings me to my next point: we should not focus here too much on this specific use case, as the issue is more generally about Snippet events.
