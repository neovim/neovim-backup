That was the idea behind #9943 (not merged), and is still tracked in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1180\n\nWhat's needed for your particular use-case (async `:global`) is an ergonomic interface that makes it easy to send a command that opens buffers temporarily in the child `nvim`, performs some operations, and gets the results back.\n\nRealistically this probably would look analogous to python's [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module. This would be driven by the \"shada\" subsystem: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/47866cd8d20c62afa8a3c3929d3aada2db9162f5/src/nvim/context.c#L1\n\nIf we get that, then it would be straightforward to also expose it as a `:& ...` command modifier. So for example, your case would look like:\n\n    :& g/^\\[/normal! da[\n\nthen once the child is finished, it would show a notification.",
