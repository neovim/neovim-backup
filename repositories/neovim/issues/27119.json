The old \"provider\" pattern could not be \"stacked\": if you override `clipboard.vim` you can't re-use the builtin functionality, you must reimplement the entire thing.\r\n    -  Plus potential [future enhancements](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/22598)\r\n\r\nSo the \"provider\" pattern  is an unnecessary concept that adds cognitive overhead for Nvim users.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n- Move all the old providers to ~~vim.ui~~ `vim.os` (~~vim.ui is probably a fine place for all providers to live~~ (after more thought, `vim.ui` is probably too confusing to overload for this purpose; introduce `vim.os` instead for clipboard/etc.)).\r\n- Remove support for the old `{runtime}/provider/*` concept, and related documentation.\r\n    - For back-compat, it's probably not too difficult to shim the old `provider#clipboard#Call()` to the new module.",

Existing providers at the moment are rplugins (python, node, perl, ruby) and clipboard:\r\n\r\n- Clipboard is a member that belongs to `vim.ui` (as osc52 already does), see `vim.ui.clipboard`\r\n- But rplugins were called providers because they *provide* `providers#{lang}#Call()` to be called from C. Module-wise, they are about RPC support rather than UI, so `vim.ui` wouldn't be a good choice. I can suggest: `vim.remote` (but we may want to distinguish this from #21635), `vim.rpc`, etc.",

The concern of \"rplugin providers\" is too general and wide. If `:pydo`, etc. were about user interface then all other core features (buffers, windows, treesitter, etc.) would also concerning UIs too, after all. Some mid-level utilities and APIs such as notifications, prompts (e.g. `vim.ui.select()`), pop-up (floating windows) as a core util #25514, etc. are directly concerning user interfaces though.\r\n\r\nI think a better categorization can focus on their remote/RPC nature (their implementation and protocol) or external Language support for scripting, rather than on their function, i.e., what they are for (remote \"plugins\", eventually, for better UI/UX).",
