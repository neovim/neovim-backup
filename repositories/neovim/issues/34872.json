To use more than one workspaceFolders you always need some heuristic to make that decision and you need to know that the language server actually supports it in a meaningful way (many don't). So imho this is out of scope for core\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- document guidance\n- via [Mathias](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/24054#issuecomment-1598155339):\n  > we could extend `vim.lsp.start` to automatically extend the `workspaceFolders` if `reuse_client` returns true, to make it easier to use)\n\n",
