    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, neovim saves undo history only when writing a buffer to a file. However, when neovim is embedded in other editors, say, vscode, it may happen that the neovim never actually writes the buffer into files, which is done by vscode. In this situation, we don't have persistent undo. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPlease add some feature such that vscode-neovim can use native undo history.  See  https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/issues/474",
