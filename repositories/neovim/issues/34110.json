    "body": "### Problem\n\nI get an error with neovim when I click into the buffer (at any location in the buffer) after clicking off and using another window.\n\nThis issue is very frequent, but not entirely predictable. I can't tell what makes it not happen on the occasions when it doesn't. One thing I think does prevent this is that when I have more than two buffers open, this issue does not occur. \n\nI can't find a traceback for the error in the nvim logs in my `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nvim/log` file either. I managed to quickly screengrab it on two occasions. After clicking, this error briefly pops up and then neovim just closes (but the terminal does not).\n\n```\nnvim: /builddir/build/BUILD/neovim-0.11.1-build/neovim-0.11.1/src/nvim/mouse.c:709: do_mouse: Assertion `false && \"winbar, statusline and statuscolumn only support %@ for clicks\"' failed.\n```\n\nBelow are images of two different times where I was able to screengrab this issue just before neovim crashed.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/416f33b0-1e74-4f64-99ff-c168e082fab8)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f73f3308-a75f-4da4-b0c9-9d7c18a28a60)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim somefile.txt\nclick onto another window, do something like scrolling around or whatever for a few seconds\nclick on nvim window\n-> nvim crashes\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI do not expect this to crash. I don't get this issue on MacOS with wezterm.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.1.1275\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nFedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20250518_060218_5663e749\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\ndnf, (sudo dnf install neovim)",
