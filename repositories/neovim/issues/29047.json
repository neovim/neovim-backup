This seems to only occur when `set nottimeout` is enabled. The inconsistency suggests a startup race condition.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n`nvim --clean --cmd 'set nocompatible' --cmd 'set nottimeout' ~/.vimrc`\r\n\r\nRemoving the `--cmd 'set nottimeout'` seems to greatly reduce if not eliminate the issue.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the file to appear in the buffer as it does on disk. The buffer state should initially be unmodified.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n% nvim -v NVIM v0.10.0 Build type: Release LuaJIT 2.1.1713773202\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno, vim 9.0.1544 (nor a previous forgotten nvim 0.9.x version)\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 11.7.10\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nReproduced with two: iTerm2, Wezterm\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\niTerm2:xterm-256color, Wezterm:wezterm (with terminfo installed)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nbrew install neovim",

Instead of a single character being replaced, I see tens or hundreds of characters written to the buffer. Obviously there are many vim commands running as part of `colorscheme`, which complicates things a bit, but it does seem to make the issue easier to reproduce.\n\nI see this with nvim 0.10.3 and 0.10.2.
