Unlike macros, however, the work could be divided between several threads. This could be used for running a macro on every line for example though there are probably more advanced uses I am unaware of.\n\nI know this might be a very large task and is specific to a minority of use cases so I would be willing to try and implement it I am just wondering if there are any problems with the idea.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf the selection that :norm is being applied to is larger than .e.g. 50000 lines, divide the lines into batches and run them on different threads",

            "body": "The general answer to this is to build a strong story around \"p2p\" features, i.e. being able to share state seamlessly to concurrent `nvim` processes, and manage them.\n\nPart of that story is `vim.async`, part of it is maturing the shada/context concept. It's tracked in the [multiproc tag](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22multiproc%22) and https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1180 .\n\nWe absolutely aren't going to fiddle around with adding \"multithread\" support to random features like `:normal`. The answer must be instead, sharing state and orchestrating processes, and gathering their results. That *could* mean we need better ways to *get results* from `:normal`. No one is blocked today from thinking about that and working on better ways to surface editor state in the API.",
