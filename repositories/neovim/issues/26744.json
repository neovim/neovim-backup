Most Linux Shells use a backslash (`\\`), Powershell uses a backtick (`` ` ``) and Windows CMD uses a circumflex (`^`) as escape character. The reason I said there's no mechanism on Windows is, that contrary to Linux environments, Neovim doesn't use a terminfo library on Windows to look at those overrides. So even if you put an override file in the same place on Windows as you would on Linux, it just won't be read.",

This was taken into consideration while implementing these features for WT.\n\nThe steps to detect support for SGR4:X and SGR58/59 would be like:\n1. Set undercurl via `\\e[4:3m` sequence.\n2. and immediately check with the terminal if it was successfully set using DECRQSS `\\eP$qm\\e\\`\n3. If the DECRPSS response contains 4:3, it was set and that also means that the terminal supports undercurl.\n\nYou could combine it with SGR58 and it should work as well.",

This was taken into consideration while implementing these features for WT.\n> \n> The steps to detect support for SGR4:X and SGR58/59 would be like:\n> 1. Set undercurl via `\\e[4:3m` sequence.\n> 2. and immediately check with the terminal if it was successfully set using DECRQSS `\\eP$qm\\e\\`\n> 3. If the DECRPSS response contains 4:3, it was set and that also means that the terminal supports undercurl.\n> \n> You could combine it with SGR58 and it should work as well.\n\nThanks for mentioning that. I will try implementing these and see. This will hopefully fix the issue where old version of WT won't render the underlines. Addetionally if this works, no need to add a new terminfo entry in the builtin terminfo list",
