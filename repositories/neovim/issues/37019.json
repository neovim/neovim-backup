            "body": "Instead of falling back to the normal line diff, why not merge the adjacent changed blocks separated by a space or maybe punctuation? It will still remain word focused without making it line diff. I seen the diff.c file a bit and even tho I dont have much experience in C more in C++. But I think the logic might be same, where we check the blocks in both files if the gap is small enough or gap is not too large, we merge them it a continuous highlight.\n\nBasic Flow I am thinking:\n1. Check if both blocks are on the same line. \n2. Calculate the gap size between them (in bytes)\n3. If gap is too big, skip it\n4. Is it a whitespace || Is it a punctuation -> merge them\n5. Verify if the changes are significant vs gap size\n6. If all the checks pass, merge the block\n\nNote: Some of the logic been taken from diff_refine_inline_char_highlight function in diff.c\n\nHappy to make an PR if the logic is good enough!",
