What is the actual size of the problem being solved, and is it worth the cost of complicating the highlight layer.\n\nHere is the gist based on my experience with 'mini.statusline' and 'mini.tabline'.\n\n---\n\nLet's say I want to create a statusline section (i.e. a dedicated part of statusline that shows grouped data) for diagnostics. I also want it to be visually different from the rest of the statusline, so I create `SLineDiagnostics` highlight group and suggest it to use background different from `StatusLine`.\n\nThe problem starts if users want to have each diagnostic level be highlighted with different *foreground* colors. The natural choice here is to use `DiagnosticXxx` highlight group, *but* if they use `%#SLineDiagnostics# %#DiagnosticError#E: 2` then the `E: 2` part will be highlighted with `StatusLine` background and not `SLineDiagnostics` background.\n\nThe workaround here is to manually create dedicated highlight groups for all diagnostic levels and explicitly set *both* background and foreground colors. Which is doable, but doesn't scale well.\n\n---\n\nAn example of not scaling well is something like adding highlighting for filetype icons in tabline/bufferline. In 'mini.tabline' the \"tab\" (that shows single listed buffer) is highlighted based on the combination of whether it is current/visible/hidden and whether the buffer is modified or not. So in total there are 6 different highlight groups, while each may have its own background. Let's say that filetype icon can have a limited set of foreground colors, like 9 in case of 'mini.icons'. So for icons to have foreground colors, there needs to be 6\\*9=54 dedicated highlight groups just for that. Which is a bit too much to handle for all color schemes that want to support 'mini.tabline' and colored icons.\n\nThe \"solution\" the statusline and tabline plugins are required to go with is to dynamically create these dedicated highlight groups based on the cherry-picked plugins (icon providers) or functionality (diagnostic levels) they choose to support. This is cumbersome and error prone. Having a way to say \"apply this highlight group combined with earlier defined attributes\" might solve this issue more cleanly.",
