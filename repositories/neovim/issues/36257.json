    "body": "### Problem\n\nCan consistently cause NeoVim to crash when just typing in insert mode, seemingly due to large completions list.\nWhen LSP is disabled the crash does not occur, which is why I think it has something to do with the new NeoVim LSP capabilities.\nI am not using omnifunc or anything at time of crash, nothing that I am doing is me interacting with the LS, it is something in the background.\n\n```terraform\n\n  value       = module.management.log_analytics_workspace[  #<-- Typed up to here with no issues\n  value       = module.management.log_analytics_workspace[\" #<-- Crashed!\n``` \n\nI don't believe it to be a Terraform specific issue for a few reasons:\n- The exact same LS and test case works in VsCode without issue.\n- The nvim process is the one using 100% CPU, I suspect it is a generic issue that just surfaces easily when using Terraform.\n- It does not crash on every `[ ` in Terraform, it seems to only happen when I would expect the LS to be returning lots of information (All of the parameters of a resource for instance, which gets noisy quick).\n  - Where it does crash it does so 100% consistently, just like it seems to work 100% consistent without issues in other places.\n\nApologies for not being able to offer more information up front, I am not a developer myself and my rudimentary stack traces revealed nothing, but I don't know if that is just me not knowing how to do that correctly.\n\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\n1. Install Terraform LS\n\n```bash\nbrew install terraform-ls`\n```\n\n2. Create `init.lua`\n\n```lua\nvim.lsp.config['tf'] = {\n  -- Command and arguments to start the server.\n  cmd = { \"terraform-ls\", \"serve\" },\n  -- Filetypes to automatically attach to.\n  filetypes = { 'terraform', 'terraform-vars' },\n  -- Sets the \"workspace\" to the directory where any of these files is found.\n  -- Files that share a root directory will reuse the LSP server connection.\n  -- Nested lists indicate equal priority, see |vim.lsp.Config|.\n  root_markers = { '.git' },\n  -- Specific settings to send to the server. The schema is server-defined.\n  -- Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua/master/setting/schema.json\n  settings = {\n  }\n}\nvim.lsp.enable('tf')\nvim.lsp.set_log_level(\"debug\")\n```\n\n3. Create `main.tf`\n\n```hcl\nterraform {}\n\nmodule \"management\" {\n  source  = \"Azure/avm-ptn-alz-management/azurerm\"\n  version = \"0.6.0\" # change this to your desired version, https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/version-constraints\n}\n\noutput \"broken\" {\n  description = \"Adding a double quote or a number after the [ on line 34 causes cpu to go to 100% and indefinitely hangs nvim\"\n  value       = module.management.log_analytics_workspace[\n}\n```\n\n4. Attempt to edit line 10 in `main.tf`\n\na.\n```bash\nnvim -u init.lua main.tf\n```\n\nb. Move to line 10, and try to add a \" or number\n\n``` hcl\n  value       = module.management.log_analytics_workspace[ \n  value       = module.management.log_analytics_workspace[\" <-- Crash!\n```\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-1471+gbe73c35943-Homebrew Build type: Release LuaJIT 2.1.1760617492\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nterraformls 0.38.2\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04.5 LTS (WSL)\n\n### Log file\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/ryan-royals/a8b6fe979ec5db759dcc166da5a93dcd",
