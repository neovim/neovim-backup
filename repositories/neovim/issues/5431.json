Here are the reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Vim tabs are actually the right design, each tab is a layout and the user can switch between them easily. When `:help` (and `:copen` and probably others that I don't know about) is run the whole point of having different layouts on each tab is lost.\r\n2. Most commands behave the same, with exceptions, so the user must remember those especial cases to avoid disrupting the layout. Even if something like `:0te` is implemented (I would prefer something like `:current te` if it happens), there would be a default behaviour and a bunch of special cases :( I prefer consistency.\r\n\r\nOne can argue that the user that the user could have custom commands with the desire behaviour, and that's what I do, but it would be awesome if Neovim where more consistent than Vim, so I wouldn't need to remember to use my custom commands instead of the default `:help`. I don't expect the behaviour of `:help` to be changed, I know compatibility with Vim is more important, but it would be nice if `:terminal` was kept as is (plus support for `:vertical`, `:tab` and others)",
