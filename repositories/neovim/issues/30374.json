This fixes the crash with my tests of the 5,000col 5,000row terminal window when printing roughly 30,000 chars. But when I bring the tests up to 50,000col 50,000row term, I get a separate crash here:\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/3d1f907912e25cb7a83163423c75dc67a0aea126/src/nvim/terminal.c#L1974\n\nI'm currently thinking that is unrelated to the current issue but I haven't looked super deep into it yet.",
