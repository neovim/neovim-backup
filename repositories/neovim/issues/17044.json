    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Feature description\n\nI was wondering if there were plans on either adding a multi-selection function similar to `vim.ui.select()` or an optional argument to `vim.ui.select()` to allow the user to select multiple options.\r\n\r\nWhen used without extensions, the selections could maybe be comma-separated values or another type of delimiter like spaces, and it could return an iterable like a list for the `{on-choice}` function to go through. Hopefully extensions like the [telescope ui select extension](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim) could then pass the user's highlighted (typically through `<tab>`) selections as well. \r\n\r\nThis would be handy for any plugin that may wish to iterate through multiple user selections rather than doing one each function call. For example, if a plugin that manages neovim sessions has an option to delete existing sessions from the session directory, and it wishes to use `vim.ui.select()` for the user to select which sessions to delete, the user would currently have to call the function multiple times to delete multiple selections. However, if there were a multi-selection option, the plugin developer could just have the user select all the sessions they wish to delete at once, then iterate through the list and repeatedly call the deletion function in the code.",
