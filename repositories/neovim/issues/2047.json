That said, I usually edit files with the sh extension and then run then with SingleCompile.\n\n> Also, :! does not work with a new, unsaved buffer. It should.\n\nAt first sight, this indeed seems like a limitation we inherited from vanilla vim, and since we only use pipes there's no reason why we can't do this. (then again, I recall now that Vim also saves the output to a temp file, which it could do for unsaved buffers equally well).\n",
