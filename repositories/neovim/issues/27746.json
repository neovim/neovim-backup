    "body": "### Problem\n\nI think that the documentation of `&channel` to access the job id of currently running Neovim terminals could be more robust.  \r\n\r\nLet's compare it with `conceallevel`.\r\n\r\nIf I'm on a help page I can do either\r\n\r\n```\r\nset conceallevel=3\r\n```\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\nlet &conceallevel=3\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then when I do `:h conceallevel` I get a clear explanation for what it is.  And If I know that I can use the `let &` syntax understand what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast, in a terminal buffer we have the quasi-setting `channel` accessible in vimscript with `&channel`.  When we do `:h channel` it goes into the very dense documentation of channels that one needs some deep technical knowledge to understand, and one would have to do some digging to realize that `channel` is documented in `:h terminal-emulator`, and even then, the user will have to know the `&setting` syntax for dealing with variables.  It is further not super clear whether any of the other various channel functions in the `:h channel` documentation set `&channel`.   \r\n\r\nAs a side note, the documentation for `job-id` says that each `job-id` is a valid `channel-id`. It is not clear if the reverse is true, and if `valid` means currently running, or `can take that value eventually`.  \r\n\r\nRight now it seems that `&channel` is just for terminals started with `term` and `termopen()`, but, but that is not completely clear from the documentation; I got info that from reading github issues/online articles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRecommended changes.\r\n\r\n- Make it clear in `:h channel` the existence of the quasi-setting `channel` that is currently documented in `:h terminal-emulator`\r\n\r\n- Make it clear in both locations exactly when and how `&channel` is set. By any job or just by `:term` and `:termopen`\r\n\r\n- Add a reminder of the `&` syntax for getting this option in both locations.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that this issue betrays that I'm not an expert, and that I've missed something.  But documentation is not for experts, it is for people to learn from, and I think that these sections could use some clarification. \r\n \r\nIt is also possible that there is a better way of improving this documentation than what I've suggested above.\r\n\r\nI could open a PR but I still have more to grasp on the github workflow to do one smoothly in this project, and I also have a lot more to grasp on the standard for terseness vs ease of understanding for the Neovim documentation.",
