However storing config there seems a little odd.\r\n\r\n`AppData\\Local` and `AppData\\LocalLow` are both designed to be kept local to that computer. Whereas `AppData\\Roaming` is designed to support being synced to a server. Meaning that in a situation where a user might move around computers the local folders wouldn't follow them but the roaming folder would.\r\n\r\n[Which AppData folder to use?](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/local-localnow-roaming-folders-windows-10)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nStoring neovim's config inside `%APPDATA%` would allow for neovim configs to follow users across machines (in environments that have roaming profiles). As an added bonus `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\nvim-data` could then be renamed to just `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\nvim` but that is more a personal preference.",
