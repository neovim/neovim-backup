So I got a  (probably bad) habit of always use `:so` for both Vimscript and Lua, which means if I use it with a Lua codeblock in help file, it won't work, which is a bit inconvenient to me.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf the current filetype has Treesitter support (like `help` filetype), `:so` can use Treesitter to define if the block being chosen is a Lua codeblock. If it does, execute it as Lua code block, otherwise Vim code block",
