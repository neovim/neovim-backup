    "body": "(Combined) injections currently have multiple problems:\n\n## I.\n\nHighlights from a tree can appear both in front and behind highlights with the same priority of:\n1. ancestor trees, \n2. sibling trees (of the same language, and of a different language)\n3. regular extmarks\n\nIf the given highlight is multiline, and other highlight was added on line 2+ of the given highlight.\n\nThis is easiest to see with combined injections, since the highlight can span across unrelated highlights from parent trees.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31812 - offset child highlights by internal subpriority. Priorities stay the same. Fixes issues with both ancestor trees and regular extmarks. Can be extended to siblings\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31853 - offset child highlights by priority. Mostly fixes issues with both ancestor trees and regular extrmarks. Can be extended to siblings https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/32569 - create new highlights iterator for each line. Fixes issue with ancestor and sibling trees. Potential performance problem\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/32619 - Store relevant highlights and reapply them for each line. Fixes issue with ancestor and sibling trees.\n\nMerging either of them will surface a limitation that parent highlights sometimes need to be in front of child highlights. Example is template string literals. The interpolated expression should be on top of all children.\n\n## II.\n\nChild trees can include ranges outside their parent's region. This can happen if a (parent) combined injection contains another (child) combined injection, and the match for child injection was split across multiple ranges of parent injection.\n\nPossible fixes:\n\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/32549 - clip child tree region to parent trees regions. (This is not correct? It should only clip against one parent tree that the match belongs to)\n\n## III.\n\nHighlights of a child tree can appear outside their region. This can happen if a highlight spans across multiple ranges of the tree.\n\nRequires II is fixed. Harder to test without fixing I.\n\nPossible fixes:\n\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/32549 - Clip highlight ranges to tree region.\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/32624 - same as previous.\n\n## IV.\n\n(Theoretical) Combined child injection trees might not be created. Tree sitter requires ranges in tree region to be sorted and non-intersecting. Currently the ranges are passed in the encounter order, so nothing guarantees they will not intersect or be sorted.\n\n_Originally posted by @vanaigr in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32624#issuecomment-2682539765_\n            ",
