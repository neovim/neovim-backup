My question was about the nature of such a hypothetical\r\ncontribution. Could you outline what you'd expect, in broad strokes?\r\n\r\nTo my understanding, this would need either:\r\n\r\n  A. a major revision to luv to allow it to represent/interact with more\r\nthan one loop per lua vm\r\n  B. this bit of neovim API wouldn't use luv, and reach more directly to\r\nlibuv\r\n  C. a third option that you can think of but I can't\r\n\r\nMy money is on option C :)\r\n\r\n> Message ID: ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n",
