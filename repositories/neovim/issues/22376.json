Can there be a way for the code in `cmdexpand.c` to be modified in such a way to achieve this?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'm not sure exactly how LSP is done on neovim because I'm actually currenly a vim9 user, but for vim9 I was thinking of an extra 'tagsearch' option that functions similarly to 'tagfunc' but for cmd completion instead of jumping to the symbol definition underneath the cursor. Let me know what you all think.",
