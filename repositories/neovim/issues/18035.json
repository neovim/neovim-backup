Currently, this gives an error `E5108: Error executing lua Cannot convert given lua type`. I don't think that it is possible to full extent, but it seems to be doable for some simple cases with `string.dump` and `loadstring`.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n- Create Neovim server: `nvim --clean --listen /tmp/nvim.pipe`.\r\n- Create Neovim client: `nvim`.\r\n- In Neovim client run:\r\n    - `:lua channel = vim.fn.sockconnect('pipe', '/tmp/nvim.pipe', { rpc = true })`\r\n    - Try running `:lua f = vim.rpcrequest(channel, 'nvim_exec_lua', 'return function() print(\"New function\") end', {})`. It gives `E5108` error.\r\n    - `:lua f_dump = vim.rpcrequest(channel, 'nvim_exec_lua', 'return string.dump(function() print(\"New function\") end)', {})`.\r\n    - `:lua f = loadstring(f_dump); f()`. Should print `New function`.",

If having functions in the RPC request output is impossible to do in automated fashion to any degree, then this should have been closed two years ago. If it is possible, then \"low hanging approach of handling that\" was meant as opposed to \"fully preserve a function with all its upvalues as much as possible\".\r\n\r\nI assumed that this is possible to do automatically at least to some degree as most other types *can* be returned from the server and are properly reconstructed on the client side.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n> I suppose we could add direct support for this to `nvim_exec_lua`. That would be a \"widening\" type change to its parameters, which is not technically allowed by `:help api-contract` but we could consider relaxing it, especially since this is only for non-remote calls to `nvim_exec_lua`.\r\n\r\n@justinmk, as far as I understand, the current Neovim's test runner allows function *input*. Although it would be nice to have, the core of the issue (and what example shows) is the opposite: allowing functions in the *output* of the RPC request. As it is the main pain point when working with child process.",
