This is especially true if you are loading variations of the config file for testing (Is the init file loaded, is it a plugin problem, or a syntax error?).  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have a init.vim in the default folder, `:checkhealth` has a \"Missing config\" error, which makes it even more confusing. \r\n\r\n# Solution:\r\nHave $MYVIMRC and `:checkhealth` register the new init file and have nvim treat it as the default for the session.",

But I would agree with OP that it would be intuitive to set `$MYVIMRC` in these cases.\r\n\r\nIf maintainers agree, change would be somewhere here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/main.c#L1878-L1880",
