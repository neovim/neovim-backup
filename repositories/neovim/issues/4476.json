So NEOVIM draw horizontal bar incorrectly in Nerdtree.\n![2016-03-20 5 33 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4075389/13903516/ff21f34e-eec1-11e5-8a77-0b24c03cd736.png)\n\nHowever, VIM works in this case.\n![2016-03-20 5 31 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4075389/13903510/d093a810-eec1-11e5-84fd-c5aa0e7c493c.png)\n\n(first image is the NEOVIM case and second image is the VIM case)\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. make directory and files with double-width characters.

            "body": "This happens only on Mac OS X and with filenames in Hangul.\n\nThe default file system on OS X uses (a variant of) NFD for filenames,\nso a Hangul syllable in filename is decomposed into Jamo.\nFor example, 안 is decomposed into U+110B,U+1161,U+11AB, or\n\"e1 84 8b e1 85 a1 e1 86 ab\" in UTF-8.\nNeither vim nor nvim can handle decomposed Hangul correctly. For example, try\n\n```\n$ mkdir tmp && cd tmp\n$ touch 안녕\n$ ls | od -t x1 -t c\n$ ls > nfd.txt\n$ vim nfd.txt     # or nvim nfd.txt\n```\n\nThe reason that NERDTree works OK on vim is that vim transforms decomposed filenames into precomposed form (NFC). See lines 10265-10275 of src/misc1.c in the vim's git master.\nhttps://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/misc1.c#L10265-L10275\n\nIt may be possible to fix nvim so that it can handle decomposed Hangul correctly, but it would require some work. Converting into NFC, as in vim, is much easier, and in some sense more useful, because Hangul inputted by users (for searching, etc.) is usually in NFC.\n\nI've created a PR for this:  #4488 \n\n@hankook Could you please try this PR?\n",

            "body": "I installed OS X 10.11 (El Captain) on an external drive and tested on it, and have found that NERDTree and Netrw do not work well (as hankook describes) if the current directory contains Hangul, although they work fine on 10.9 or 10.8. (I can't test on 10.10 now).\n\nIt seems the behavior of the system's library function `getcwd(3)` has changed between 10.9 and 10.11; it returns NFC on 10.9 but NFD on 10.11.\n\nWith my PR, vim functions like `glob()` or `globpath()` return NFC, but on 10.11 vim function `getcwd()` now returns NFD and seems to be causing the problem in NERDTree/Netrw (although I didn't understand the detail). So it seems that converting from NFD to NFC only in **some** part of the nvim source code is not a good idea. If we want to use NFC, we may need to convert to NFC **everywhere** in the source.\n\nBut, in addition to doing so is quite tedious (if not impossible), there is another reason that we can not use NFC always. For example, there is a function `path_fix_case()` in `path.c`, which is important on OS X since the default file system is case insensitive (but case preserving). Currently this function doesn't work well on OS X for file names with accent. On OS X, `über.txt` and `Über.txt` are the same file, but this is not detected by `path_fix_case()`, because one of the name comes from user (command line) and in NFC, while the other is from the file system and in NFD. Converting both names into NFC does not work, because ü is not the lowercase of Ü in NFC; we must convert both into NFD for STRICMP to work properly.\n\nAs a result, if there is a file über.txt, and edit it by\n$ `nvim Über.txt`    # or `vim Über.txt`\nand save it from within (n)vim, then the file name changes to `Über.txt`.\n\nI guess fixing all the NFC/NFD related problems is quite a lot of work. NFD is more appropriate for comparison etc., while NFC is easier to display (counting the number of cells etc.). Possibilities may be:\n\n(1) Use NFC file names as default, and convert to NFD only where it is required (for comparison etc.)\n(2) Use NFD everywhere, and fix nvim so that it can correctly display Hangul in NFD\n(it can already correctly display other decomposed characters such as accented alphabets).\n(3) ....(other possibilities?)\n\nbut anyway it would be a lot of work...\n\n@hankook I think the current nvim (without my PR) is \"usable\" with NERDTree/Netrw although there are some display problem (did you try ctrl-L which may improve the display?). If you agree with this, applying my PR is not a good idea, because NERDTree/Netrw becomes \"unusable\" if the current directory has Hangul in it (on OS X 10.11).\n",

            "body": "As of v0.3.4 this problem is not limited to file names on macOS. Neovim seems to handle decomposed UTF-8, i.e. NFD, strings incorrectly. For example the hex representation of `한글` in NFD is\r\n\r\n```\r\ne18492e185a1e186abe18480e185b3e186af\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you open a file with above content, then the following chunks are passed from `ui_line(...)` to `ui_raw_line(...)`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[e1,84,92], [], [e1,85,a1], [e1,86,ab], [e1,84,80], [], [e1,85,b3], [e1,86,af]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `[]` denotes the empty cell for wide characters. This has wrong cell number and also wrong `[]` placement. It should be\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[e1,84,92, e1,85,a1, e1,86,ab], [], [e1,84,80, e1,85,b3, e1,86,af], []]\r\n```\r\n\r\nor if we want to only use NFC\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[ed,95,9c], [], [ea,b8,80], []]\r\n```\r\n\r\niTerm2 seem to render it correctly somehow, but if you move the cursor around, you notice that there are more than two (wide) cells.\r\n\r\nThere was also a [brief discussion](https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim?at=5c900c68dfc69a1454b72b92) on Gitter.",
