    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe built-in `<C-x><C-f>` path completion is awesome, but it only supports completing paths relative to cwd. It's more or less unusable when completing import statement paths in JS, or `include!/include_str!/include_bytes!` macros in Rust, which are all written relative to the current file.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would like to have a config option to switch the file completion to be relative to the currently open file.\nPreferably by using the existing file completion code path, rather than reimplementing it fully in Lua (eg. as an in process LSP server).\n\nI'm willing to attempt to implement this, but I'm not sure how configuration should be handled in legacy C code paths, or if we want to add new features to this code at all, and should I rather focus my time on reimplementing this as an LSP server.",
