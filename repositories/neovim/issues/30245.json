When an .editorconfig file is changed, all relevant buffers under the directory where the .editorconfig is located should get their properties updated.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nUpdate buffer options when .editorconfig change occurs.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ 'BufWritePost', 'BufRead' }, {\r\n        group = modegroup,\r\n        pattern = \"*.editorconfig\",\r\n        callback = function(args)\r\n            local buffers = vim.api.nvim_list_bufs()\r\n            for _, bufnr in ipairs(buffers) do\r\n                local valid = bufnr and vim.api.nvim_buf_is_valid(bufnr)\r\n                local name = valid and vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(bufnr)\r\n                local root = valid and vim.fn.fnamemodify(args.match, \":h\")\r\n                if root and name and #name > 0 and vim.startswith(name, root) then\r\n                    vim.b[bufnr].editorconfig = false\r\n                    require('editorconfig').config(bufnr)\r\n                end\r\n            end\r\n        end\r\n    })\r\n```\r\nExample is very crude since if you have multi level directory structure with multiple editorconfigs this will do a bit of extra unecessary work, but the editorconfig plugin already has enought context to know which buffer properties are set from which immediate editorconfig. Buffer/File renames/moves are already handled i believe but extra care might need to be taken.",

Chances are not just a couple of files opened in nvim will get changed from outside tools, and this will have compound behavior. That is why the implementation has to be changed / inverted and detect changes to the editorconfig and apply them to the affected buffers, not the other way around. ",
