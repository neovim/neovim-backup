To enable it you just run `:set spell spellang=<LANG>`, replacing <LANG> with your language code eg. en_US for American English\r\n\r\nSorry, you completely missed the point of this ticket. Of course, we all know about the Bram’s spellchecker, I use it (in neovim, of course, it works perfectly fine) all the time (including now), but I, the reporter of this issue, and many many others consider it stupid that contrary to the UNIX philosophy (do one thing and do it well) and contrary to every other program in Linux, vim does spellchecking on its own and doesn’t use the system spellchecker (on Linux it is hunspell, most of the time). Internal vim spellchecker is old, basically unmaintained (because almost unmaintainable) code in the biggest C file in the project, which should go and be replaced by the binding to the external spellchecker. One attempt to do so was ignored by Bram in https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/2500, other option would be to make spellchecker as a [remote plugin](https://neovim.io/doc/user/remote_plugin.html), but currently everybody who took a look at ``spell.c`` run away crying and nothing has changed.",

Yes, vim’s internal spellchecker might be a good idea when it was introduced (the earliest tag I found on the GitHub repo was v7.0131 from 2005-08-07), but circumstances has changed since then. Everybody and their dog have some kind of packaging system, so it is not that big deal to depend on the external library/program.\r\n\r\nThat pull request (if finished, it never really completely worked) would be better than what we have now, but the ideal situation would be IMHO some kind of the remote plugin API, so we can have plugins for even unforeseen spellchecker, because the development in that area seems to be still in flux (I have just learned about existence of https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell and there are certainly others).",

Problem with enchant is that it brings glib as additional external dependency and that is probably unacceptable to both Bram and neovim maintainers.\r\n\r\n> One question I have is, what should happen to the internal spell checker if support is added for an external/system spell checker? Should it remain for complete backwards compatibility, and in case a system spell checker isn't available? Or should it be removed completely in favor of the new system?\r\n\r\nIt should certainly be removed. If somebody want to rewrite the internal vim spellchecker into an independent library/independent program which could be bundled with vim as its default spellchecker, no problem with that.",

Now, I think it does make sense for an LSP server to indicate which regions of the file are eligible for spell checking (ex comments and strings), possibly tied in with [semantic syntax highlighting](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/18). And possibly have a mechanism for the LSP server to give the editor a list of words that should be considered correctly spelled for that file. But I don't think the spell checking and recommendations themselves should be the responsibility of the LSP.  Not to mention, what if you are editing a file that doesn't have an LSP server, or the LSP server doesn't support spellcheck, and you still want to run spell check?",

Now, I think it does make sense for an LSP server to indicate which regions of the file are eligible for spell checking (ex comments and strings)\r\n\r\n@tmccombs Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant (although I wasn't clear maybe): the only spellcheck-related role of the LSP is to isolate these regions, then forward to the actual spellchecker. This way no spellchecker has to be written twice.\r\n\r\n> what if you are editing a file that doesn't have an LSP server?\r\n\r\nWell, there must be at least 1 lightweight, spellcheck-only LSP, whose only job is to forward the file to the spellcheker and return the linting information. The linting logic is already shared with other LSPs, and the actual analysis of the file is very basic (it's just 1 big region to spellcheck).\r\n\r\n> or the LSP server doesn't support spellcheck, and you still want to run spell check?\r\n\r\nMy point is that such a server would *not* be considered LSP-compliant if spellchecking were actually part of the [protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol). This is why I think about dropping them a line. If spellchecking is added to LSP, then all LSP servers will have to integrate their share of language-specific spellchecking logic. I'll open a thread there, just to take the temperature on that.  \r\nIn the meantime, yeah, there will exist incomplete LSP-servers with no spellchecking support yet. In this transient situation, maybe it's good enough to run the lightweight, spellcheck-only LSP server in parallel? I have to admit that I don't know how difficult it is to accept two parallel sources of linting.\r\n\r\n> btw, vim syntax files have a way to specify which parts of a file should be spell checked.\r\n\r\nI personally find this WET, since the vim syntax file and the LSP server internal parsing logic are duplicates of each other.",

Then spellcheck could work basically the same way with an LSP server as without one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout compatibility..\r\n\r\n> That would break backwards-compatibility.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I don't understand why, or which compatibility.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout which spellchecker to use..\r\n\r\n> the LSP server has to deal with issues like determining which spellchecker to use, cross-platform compatibility etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is better tackled by the client. LSP clients have config files dedicated to explicit these choices with entries like `spellchecker-to-use: \"path/to/my/favourite/spellchecker\"`, and clients know platform specificities.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis said, I understand that there is still something blurry in the process:\r\n\r\n- client sends buffer content to LSP server\r\n- server parses and delimitates spellcheck regions\r\n- ..what next? Either:\r\n  - server returns regions to client\r\n  - client passes corresponding pieces of text to the spellchecker\r\n  - spellchecker processes and returns lints\r\n  - client displays lints? It feels duplicate because the spellchecker acts like a small, adventice LSP server in this case, and there is already a lint-information exchange between the LSP server and the client. Also, the interface between each possible \\<client, spellchecker\\> pair has to be determined (a matrix problem?).\r\n- .. or:\r\n  - client informs server of which spellchecker to use\r\n  - server passes regions to spellchecker chosen by client\r\n  - spellchecker processes and returns lints\r\n  - server returns lints to client like ordinary LSP lints. This feels less duplicate, but it still implies that each \\<spellchecker\\> gets involved in correctly interfacing with LSP on demand.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether spellcheckers output are already standardized in any way. If they are, then the latter interfacing is a one-shot standardizing effort from LSP, then implementation repercuted on each LSP server. If they are not, then it also imply that one LSP-specific interface needs be featured by each spellchecker, in addition to how they already work. This sounds like a long-run effort indeed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as an appointed \"astronaut\", I agree that there is nothing neovim-specific left in this piece of the discussion, so maybe we should better move it [there](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/1017).",

            "body": "Hi, I am reviving this issue after some comments on vim/vim about hunspell integration (especially for french dictionnaries, which are horrible).\r\n\r\nThe main arguments in vim/vim (which are all valid in vim/vim's context) are:\r\n1. VimSpell, at the time, was faster than any other spellchecking library\r\n2. VimSpell is licenced under the same terms as vim, which allows distributions along with it without hastle\r\n3. VimSpell requires no extra dependency\r\n4. VimSpell can detect rare words (`SpellRare`), and words from other variants of a language (`SpellLocal`)\r\n\r\nNow to answer to those points one by one:\r\n1. It looks like, after some experiments that follow [these guidelines](https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/tree/master/tests/suggestiontest) VimSpell is actually _slower_ than hunspell at both spellchecking (~0.02 secs for hunspell, ~0.03 secs for VimSpell, may be a fluke) and suggestions (many times, VimSpell took ~25 minutes, hunspell did the whole list in 2 minutes)\r\n2. In neovim, this licencing problem seems to have disappear: we already rely on libraries that use different licences than us.\r\n3. See answer to 2.: we already rely on external libraries\r\n4. This one is trickier, since version 1.3.0, hunspell can report rare words, so `SpellRare` is supported. I did not look into haw `SpellLocal` is implemented, but if it is an extension to the dictionnary format, then it is quite probably not supported. In the contrary, if this is part of the MySpell specification then hunspell probably silently supports it, as it supports MySpell dictionnaries.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, using hunspell should allow us to stop us from using the weird dictionnary management setup that vim/vim uses (download dictionnary files and such) and only use the system dictionnaries, which seems a lot better (to me at least).",

Although, as far as I know there aren't existing tools to do that conversion, and I'm not even sure it is possible without data loss. \r\n\r\n> (plus it's easy to hit `zg`). \r\n\r\nAs long as you are confident you spelled it correctly 😉. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> > I think the ideal would be a way to make the spell checker pluggable.\r\n> \r\n> Doesn't really solve anything if all the backends suck.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if they all suck, but in different ways, you can pick the one that works best for you.  If you can switch engines at runtime you could even do something like use hunspell by default, but if it doesn't give good suggestions, switch to aspell to see if that gives you better suggestions. \r\n\r\n",

And if you want to make an universal system spellchecker (or spellchecker for Google Chrome, Firefox, LibreOffice, Mac OS X) the reality crashes on you heavily that English is not language of majority of humankind. Yes, I know, I was trying to use aspell for `cs_CZ` … you wouldn’t believe how that was bad.",
