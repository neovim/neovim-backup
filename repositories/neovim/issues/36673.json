    "body": "### Problem\n\nI'm not aware of a simple way to update the settings of an already running LSP server.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSending a `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification prompts the server to pull the new workspace configuration from the client. The `settings` field is basically [legacy](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/676), but still needs to be considered for some edge cases. While `rust_analyzer` completely ignores the field, it's still required to be present so the notification parameters get parsed without any errors. `tinymist` is even more tricky, since it checks if the `settings` field is a JSON object and if so uses it directly without the additional server request. I guess this isn't spec compliant behavior, but it might be worth considering still sending the full settings value in the notification to support legacy behavior.\nRegarding the `workspace/configuration` handler, I think no changes are necessary, apart from updating `settings` of the active clients.\n\nThis would allow reconfiguring an already running server, without the need for a full restart.\n\nI currently have the following code snippet, which lets me change the server settings of `rust_analyzer`:\n```lua\n    for _, client in ipairs(vim.lsp.get_clients({ name = \"rust_analyzer\" })) do\n        -- Update the settings on the active client.\n        client.settings = vim.lsp.config.rust_analyzer.settings\n        -- Send a notification with empty settings, rust_analyzer pulls the\n        -- configuration using a `workspace/configuration` request.\n        client:notify(\"workspace/didChangeConfiguration\", { settings = {} })\n    end\n```\n\nIt would be great if this notification and the settings update would be done automatically if the server updated using `vim.lsp.config` has an active client.",

Since learning how to extend a table or create an autocmd is unavoidable for a feature-rich setup, I don't insist on a separate wrapper for this simple case.\n\n### On default behavior\n\nI agree with your point about flexibility. Also, such change would require worrying about receiving a proper response from the server, its capabilities, other quirks like:\n\n>```lua\n> -- Send a notification with empty settings, rust_analyzer pulls the\n> -- configuration using a `workspace/configuration` request.\n>```\n\n### On alternatives\n\nThis seems like something that could instead be added to docs when `lsp.ClientCapabilities` receive their own section. I understand that `:notify()` is one-way, but not without side-effects. So I think we would have to mention checking: supported requests, server and client capabilities. And the \"upper bound\" of client capabilities seems to be the only missing piece.",
