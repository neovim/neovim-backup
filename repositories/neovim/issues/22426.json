Combined injection query should be run on the entire source because the invisble part of the region affects the visible part, just like the root language. So the partial query execution (using `start` and `stop` params of `iter_matches`) should be applied only to non-combined injections. However, currently there is no way to iterate only the matches that have some specific metadata. The simpliest solution I can think of is to have two separate query files for combined and non-combined ones.\r\n",

This requires some sort of persistent ID for each region and the corresponding tree so that the old tree can be used when parsing the corresponding region. The current implementation of LanguageTree simply uses the index of the region in the whole list of regions captured by the last execution of the injection query, which is frequently invalidated. Unfortunately, treesitter doesn't seem to provide such a functionality. Using the equality of the region value could be an option, but that looks inefficient.\r\n\r\nEven if there were some ID mechanism that allows incremental parsing of injected regions, I think it would be still inefficient because all those regions should be adjusted after each edit. So the parser would need to discard trees (e.g., with LRU cache) to balance the cost of maintaining the existing trees and parsing the new regions from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/26827",
