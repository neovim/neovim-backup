Fully empty space in the minimap is handled not using the ascii space character, but \\u2800 (an empty braille character).\n\nIt seems the color blending logic that decides whether to show the character behind the floating window or the character on the floating window itself appears to be checking the floating window's character at the position against general whitespace but not considering more obscure empty characters.\n\nI haven't looked at the code but given that tabs are also handled at expected (showing the character in the window below), I would hazard a guess as to there being a whitespace chars list or some sort of regex. Would it be possible to add unicode clear characters to this list?\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFill a text file with unicode \\u2800\nFill another file with text\nenable winblend for telescope windows\nview the preview for the unicode text file in telescope above the other file\nobserve that the unicode character, although empty, overrides the character in the file below the telescope window.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45308db7-b4b8-4f2b-9f79-aea8033c493c) \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0a4acd0-66a0-4675-8ba5-5c8aaafeebba)\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN / A - winblend is a neovim only feature\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArchlinux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nxterm\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nArch User Repository (AUR)",
