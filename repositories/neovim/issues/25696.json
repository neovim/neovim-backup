Looking at the roadmap here, I think that the answer is yes since \"nested placeholders\" is marked as completed. But I don't think that snippets like that work currently. (In experiments, if I use `${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE:placeholder}}`, the tabstop is empty rather than filled with either `TM_FILENAME_BASE` or `placeholder`. Things like `${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}` and `${1:$TM_FILENAME_BASE}` also leave the tabstop empty.)",
