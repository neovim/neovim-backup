    "body": "### Problem\n\nAs documented in `:help startup`, Nvim first creates buffers for files specified as command-line args (step 2), and only then processes `$MYVIMRC` (step 7). This means that the buffers created in step 2 inherit global options from Nvim's defaults, rather than from the customizations in `$MYVIMRC`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ echo 'setglobal colorcolumn=5' >vimrc\r\n$ nvim -u vimrc foo\r\n# foo shows no colorcolumn, but newly created buffers, e.g. `:e bar`, will.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this behavior is documented (but see caveat below), it tends to be surprising for users (see e.g. [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21004#issuecomment-1307781284) or [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/1712)), who expect that the `foo` buffer *should* in fact inherit options set with `setglobal` in `$MYVIMRC`. I would argue this is a reasonable expectation, because the actual behavior makes `setglobal` basically useless for `$MYVIMRC`.\r\n\r\nFor most users, this issue gets papered over because they use `set` instead of `setglobal` in their `$MYVIMRC`, and `set` sets both local and global values. However, `set` has the disadvantage that when users run `:source $MYVIMRC` during an editing session, it will reset local values *for the current buffer*. This is undesirable, as these values may have been customized (manually or via a modeline).\r\n\r\nHistorically, the incentives to use `set` over `setglobal` were 1) documentation / inertia and 2) it's considerably less to type. But `init.lua` and the Lua option interfaces are an opportunity to reset some of that inertia, and Lua makes it easy to define clean aliases, rendering point 2 moot:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n-- I can swap these locals out for vim.o / vim.opt in one place.\r\nlocal o = vim.go\r\nlocal opt = vim.opt_global\r\n-- Subsequent option definitions just use o and opt.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, while the documentation suggests that *all* buffers should ignore global options set in `$MYVIMRC`, in practice, I've observed this only applies to the *first* buffer (hence the title of the issue), all subsequent ones actually *do* inherit said global options. In other words, the current behavior is thus not only counterintuitive, but also inconsistent when passing multiple files to edit at the command line. This holds for both Nvim and Vim, try e.g. the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ echo 'setglobal colorcolumn=5' >vimrc\r\n$ nvim -u vimrc -O foo bar\r\n# foo shows no colorcolumn, but bar does.\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI think the intuitive and useful behavior would be that the buffer for the first command-line file inherits `setglobal` options from `$MYVIMRC`, like any subsequent ones already do:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ echo 'setglobal colorcolumn=5' >vimrc\r\n$ nvim -u vimrc foo\r\n# foo shows a colorcolumn at column 5.\r\n```",
