    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim's `vim._defaults.lua` executes a call to `executable()` to check for the presence of `rg` and sets it as `'grepprg'`. When `rg` is not found, this process is slow and introduces unnecessary overhead during startup. Users do not expect such a heavy check in the default configuration.\n\nThis `executable()` check can cause a delay of 50–200 milli seconds, further exacerbating the performance issue. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUninstall ripgrep.\nInstall Neovim.\nStart Neovim with nvim --clean --startuptime foo.txt.\n\nObserve the execution delay caused by the executable check in `vim._defaults.lua`.\nFor example, try to delete below lines.\n\n```\n--- Default options\ndo\n  --- Default 'grepprg' to ripgrep if available.\n  if vim.fn.executable('rg') == 1 then\n    -- Use -uu to make ripgrep not check ignore files/skip dot-files\n    vim.o.grepprg = 'rg --vimgrep -uu '\n    vim.o.grepformat = '%f:%l:%c:%m'\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim should avoid calling executable to check for the presence of `rg` during startup. When `rg` is not found, the `executable()` check triggers an exhaustive path search, which significantly increases the startup time. Removing this check entirely would lead to improved performance, as users can configure `'grepprg'` manually if needed.\n\nThe performance cost of `executable()` is a well-known problem, and calling it during startup should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-dev-b1c907f\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 24.04.1 LTS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWezTerm\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",

my PC. This only happens on WSL, not in native windows.\n\nMy guess is that if WSL doesn't find the binary in WSL it starts looking at Windows (there are many `/mnt/c/...` directories in WSL path), and it's widely known that using/executing windows files in WSL is slow (that's why using `vim.ui.open()` is also slow on WSL if it has to use explorer.exe or the Windows browser).",

Yes, it would make it faster, but it will mean WSL users to lose features. For example, now users can use `gx` to open a directory in explorer.exe. Or, even better, to open a link in my browser. If neovim restricts where `executable()` looks for, those features will be lost and users will have to install a new browser on WSL just for that (which in my own case it doesn't mean just install a new browser, but also maintain configuration - like extensions, keymaps, open tabs - between both).",
