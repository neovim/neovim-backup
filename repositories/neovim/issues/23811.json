Of course now `tbl_extend_rec` would need to be renamed.\n\nI also think having the logic broken apart would be useful. Like, a lot of users, including myself probably want to implement custom merge behavior for specific types, but fallback to the existing `tbl_extend/tbl_deep_extend` behavior otherwise, and it's a bit difficult to do when all the underlying merge logic is private. I ended up copy/pasting a lot of the code trying to make my approach work.\n\nSo functions like `can_merge`, `merge`, etc would be useful when a user wants to implement their own `behavior` func.",

It's not the most efficient thing because it repeatedly deep copies, but it does preserve the metatable. I suspect there's some optimizations that could be made, but it works at least. It also somewhat eliminates my specific need for a behavior func, because my implementation preserves the original metatable of the values being merged. ",
