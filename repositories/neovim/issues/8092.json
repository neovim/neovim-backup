    "body": "In [this video](https://youtu.be/RaIwBagADVM?t=1541) the redis author mentions that Lua script bodies are cached to avoid recompilation (and more strongly: re-evaluation).\r\n\r\nThe script  and its result [are saved](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/522760fac79536eb68dc5fc70e9166f689eb76dc/src/scripting.c#L1208). Later the result is [retrieved](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/522760fac79536eb68dc5fc70e9166f689eb76dc/src/scripting.c#L1170-L1173) without compilation if the same script body is given.\r\n\r\nThis works because redis [disallows non-determinism](https://redis.io/commands/EVAL#scripts-as-pure-functions) in Lua scripts. \r\n\r\n>  Operations performed by the script cannot depend on any hidden (non-explicit) information or state ... nor any external input from I/O devices. ... Things like using the system time, calling Redis random commands like RANDOMKEY, or using Lua random number generator ...\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this could be applicable to `nvim_exec_lua` or `ex_lua`, seems unlikely because of the \"referential transparency\" requirement.  Is it worth giving RPC clients optional control of this?\r\n\r\nI also didn't check what kind of mechanisms Lua/LuaJit already do internally to cache compilation. Though, the obvious solution is to store a function and call that function later, instead of sending a script body.",
