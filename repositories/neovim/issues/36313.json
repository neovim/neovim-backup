However, this doesn't seem to be the case:\n\n<img width=\"672\" height=\"174\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6185d723-4fb4-4c80-b76a-2ab2456a12c7\" />\n\nGitsigns still draws to the right of the diagnostics (presumably because it has lower priority). But then it should also be assigned the same column on other lines where diagnostics are missing. How it is now it just looks very out of place.\n\nAn idea would be to confine each plugin to a namespace in the sign place functions (I think this was proposed at some point). To make it backward compatible the plugin where the sign call originates from would automatically be put in it's respective namespace (which I think would also be a sensible default).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\ninstall gitsigns and define diagnostics.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n<img width=\"489\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/420e2f1b-37e5-43eb-97a8-9f782302d207\" />\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nubuntu 22.04\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nextract from release",
