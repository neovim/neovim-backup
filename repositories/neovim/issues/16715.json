This is very important in some cases, such as when editing a Git commit message and deciding to give up and abort the commit.  However, it doesn't appear the API has support for expressing the exit status of Neovim, and as such, a GUI has no way to know when Neovim exits if that's because it is broken (which some GUIs assume) or whether it's because someone invoked `:cq`.  As a result, exactly zero of the GUIs I've tried handle this case correctly (they all either display an error or exit successfully).\r\n\r\nNeovim should add a message to the API that indicates it's exiting and the exit status being used, so that a GUI can handle this case gracefully and return the proper exit code.",
