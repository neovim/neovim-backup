Either you use Nvim's internal message history, or you keep track of a different history based on your own heuristic; in both cases this new argument doesn't seem too helpful. Maybe [@bfredl](https://github.com/bfredl) can chime in.\n\nNot a big problem to not have such information although it could help to define the default choice for cases that I haven't paid much attention to so far (for example because they happened to me rarely).\n\n> Besides, (a custom) `vim.notify` seems redundant in the case of an ext_messages implementation. The implementation can already display messages however it sees fit, and the default `vim.notify()` would route messages to it and display it accordingly (and add it to the history).\n\nIndeed, I didn't found time to make sure if I really need to override `vim.notify` in my usage. Currently the built-in implementation simply uses `nvim_echo`. One detail that I overlooked is no longer present `title` option. ",
