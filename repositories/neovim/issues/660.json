The usefulness of this is indicated by the popularity of general \"fuzzy finder\" tools such as:\n- [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/tree/master/autoload/unite/filters) \n- https://github.com/tpope/vim-haystack\n- [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)\n- [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)\n- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (for bash and zsh)\n- emacs [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) consumes numerous list sources and is easily extensible, like unite.vim\n- emacs [ido-flx](https://github.com/lewang/flx) and [grizzl](https://github.com/d11wtq/grizzl) \n- Sublime Text's ctrl-p, et. al. (I don't know if it works with generic list sources)\n\nunite.vim (and ctrlp, helm, ...) has a very nice \"composable\" approach that allows the end-user to choose (and combine/intersect) from a library of _matchers_ (subsequence/fuzzy, glob, frequency) and _sorters_ (alphabetical, ordinal, rank). I suggest looking at this composable approach as a general model for providing list-searching facilities.\n\nPlugins should not have to keep reinventing the \"consume-a-list\" wheel, because the problem domain is arguably arriving at well-defined boundaries with many implementations of equivalent solutions.\n\nAn end-user (or plugin) should be able to say \"select from [list] using [fuzzy-matcher]\", and the editor should have a high-quality fuzzy matching algorithm available. The user (or plugin) should not have to implement a fuzzy-matching algorithm.\n\n_Consuming_ a list and fuzzy-matching against that list using a high-quality algorithm should be available out-of-the-box. \n\n_Providing_ the list is what plugins (and/or external tools) should focus on. E.g., [tmuxcomplete.vim](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim/) provides a list of tmux strings; [pt](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher) provides a list of matched lines; [Omnisharp](https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp) provides a list of C# symbols or types; etc, etc.\n\nPlugins like unite.vim already make very good use of Vim's buffers to provide a very featureful UI. But they shouldn't need to re-implement fuzzy matching or ranking, just like they don't need to implement regex.\n\n# Proposal\n\n- builtin FZF-like \"frecency\" selector for commands, files, etc. (see also vscode's command palette)\n- primitives (framework) to make it easier for plugins to build this kind of thing, in the spirit of `vim.lsp`\n- LSP mapping: `gr/` ([ref](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/30781#discussion_r1797719176))",
