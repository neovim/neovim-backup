    "body": " ### Problem\n\nvim_diff.txt claims that\n```help\n... This document is a complete and\ncentralized reference of the differences.\n```\nHowever,  it doesn't report all Vim features that Nvim doesn't support or Nvim is incompatible with, which leads to confusion like https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17301#issuecomment-2423192494\n\nThere are also other _big_ Vim features that Nvim doesn't support (not sure if Nvim doesn't want them or they are just missing), like `popup`, `textprop`\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee `:h vim_diff.txt`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSince Vim is still actively developed, I think it's hard to have a complete and up-to-date list of all differences between Nvim and Vim. Maybe Nvim should only compare itself against a specific Vim version, like 8.1 (since `v:version` is currently 801?) and _explicitly_ say that in the beginning of `vim_diff`?\n\nNote: \n- nvim-upstream\n  + Tutor plugin \n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-7c43f8e433\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNA\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nNA\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNA\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nNA\n\n### Installation\n\nNA",
