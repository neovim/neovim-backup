    "body": "According to [this line of code](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/2bbbb34ce78ee30c1ee53a9cb3fd1e7608185716/src/nvim/ex_cmds.c#L4489), the tag preview window gets opened with a plain `win_split` function call. The `flags` parameter is fixed to `0`. So it is not even possible to say the preview should be opened at the bottom or vertically. After all it is not possible to change how the window gets opened in any way.\nThis is said. Therefore I propose two new options. One option to define the orientation for the window where to open. The second option should allow to define a custom function that opens the window instead. This should be the same principle as `tagfunc` for example. Such an option would allow the user to do more fancy things like opening a preview window in floating manner.\n\nI'm curious what you think about this idea. Thanks for any feedback!\n",
