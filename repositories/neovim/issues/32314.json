    "body": "### Problem\n\nPerhaps people on blazingly fast hardware haven't noticed, but from neovim version 0.9.4 (0.9.4 not included), `:w` (and `:x`) are laggy. Neovim outputs \"file_name\" at the bottom, but it takes some time for it to write the usual \"XL, YB written\". (`:x` takes longer to exit.) I have tested this on every version that follows 0.9.4 and they all suffer from this. This happens on vanilla neovim, no plugins no nothing; just freshly untar'ed release binary and no configuration. I even disabled syntax highlighting in case it was related, but lag persists.\n\nEdit: commit [2a467acc86f0de25779ea421169a5cd88a42afa4](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/2a467acc86f0de25779ea421169a5cd88a42afa4) introduces this behaviour. Looking at the commit, I feel\nkind of dumb for calling this a bug, since this commit forces 'fsync' to avoid data loss after `:w` in case of hard shutdown, so it's obvious this takes more time. The real deal now is whether this should still be that way; the committer wrote: \"This may be revisited in the future when 'nofsync' can be made safer.\"\n\n### \"Solution\"\nFor anyone on older hardware (like me), doing `:set nofsync` fixes the lag. Do it at your own [risk](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9888).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim --clean\n:edit foo\nsome random text\n`:w` (notice lag)\nsome more text\n`:x` (notice lag)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nImmediate writes and exits, similar to how it was on 0.9.4 and prior.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nWhatever after 0.9.4. Take v0.10.4 for reference.\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nYes, but I don't know since when\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian 6.1.38-1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nst\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nst-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom the binary release on GitHub",
