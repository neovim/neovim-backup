    "body": "### Problem\n\nHi, I've noticed a bug that occurs when using a local arglist (via `:arglocal`), in conjunction with tab-scoped working directories (via `:tcd`) that causes `:mksession` to write `:argadd` commands with the incorrect path.\n\nFor example, I have folder `~/a` with `b.txt` inside it. I open neovim in `~` and create a new tab with `:tabnew` and `:tcd` into directory `a`, then call `:arglocal` to create a local arglist, followed by `:argadd b.txt`. At this point, `:args` shows `[b.txt]` as expected, and the file loads as expected. But if I return back to the original tab (where the working directory is still `~`), and save this session using `:mksession!`, the Session file (`Session.vim`) **incorrectly stores the `:argadd` command as `:argadd a/b.txt` instead of `:argadd b.txt`**. It's not relative to the tab-scoped working directory as I would expect it to be. The effect of this is that when you reload the session, it's now looking for the file `a/a/b.txt` instead of `a/b.txt`\n\nIn fact, if you save this session _again_ with `:mksession!`, and reload it, and save it again, and reload it and repeat over and over again, the problem just accumulates, and you end up with something like `a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/b.txt` in the arglist (when calling `:args`).\n\nInterestingly, this seems to be unique to `:tcd`. From my own testing, this issue does NOT occur for window-local working directories created with `:lcd`. In that case, it correctly preserves the path relative to the window's working directory.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n#### First create the directory structure, with file a/b.txt\nmkdir a\ncd a\ntouch b.txt\ncd ..\n\n#### Setup the `:tcd` and `:arglocal` situation, then go back to the first tab and save the session.\nnvim --clean\n  :tabnew\n  :tcd a\n  :arglocal\n  :argadd b.txt\n  :args _-- This outputs [b.txt] --_\n  gt\n  :mksession!\n  :qa\n\n#### Repeatedly load and save the same session\nnvim --clean -S\n  gt\n  :args _-- This outputs [a/b.txt] --_\n  gt\n  :mksession!\n  :qa\nnvim --clean -S\n  gt\n  :args _-- This outputs [a/a/b.txt] --_\n  gt\n  :mksession!\n  :qa\nnvim --clean -S\n  gt\n  :args _-- This outputs [a/a/a/b.txt] --_\n  gt\n  :mksession!\n  :qa\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the `:argadd` command that is saved in `Session.vim` to be correctly scoped to the tab's working directory, not the global working directory.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, vim does not support :tcd\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11 Enterprise / 23H2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal / 1.22.11141.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\n(not set)\n\n### Installation\n\nwinget",
