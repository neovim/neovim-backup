    "body": "### Problem\n\nI frequently run into annoying issues when I try to format injected languages using `==` because they aren't indented according to my usual settings for those languages. A good example is code blocks containing R, which I indent using treesitter, embedded in markdown documents, which I indent using vim syntax rules. If I try to indent my R code using `==`, Neovim treats it like markdown and the result is always very different from what I want.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be great if `==` respected injected languages. NB, I found it fairly easy to put together a small [plugin](https://github.com/wurli/contextindent.nvim) which does exactly this using `vim.filetype.get_option(\"<ft for current line>\", \"indentexpr\")`, but someone suggested that this really should be the default behaviour, hence this issue.\n\nI'd be more than happy to contribute a PR if anyone is willing to support/review.\n\nThank you!
