And anything else added eventually like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. for file editing.\r\n\r\nWould take a lot of the work out of needing to handle all of the protocol stuff and support something higher level where you can edit files, read files, run programs, etc. on the remote machine.

            "body": "Here's my 2 cents.\r\n\r\nI would love to see remote development as a feature (perhaps in a plugin, but I do want it!), but I think following the footsteps of VSCode is the wrong approach. \r\n\r\n# VSCode approach downsides\r\n1. Running Neovim on the remote takes CPU, RAM and disk space. This can be a complete dealbreaker for some of the more resource-intensive plugins, like `rust-analyzer`.\r\n2. As noted by @jdrouhard , latencies quickly become an issue, which makes remote development feeling no better than just SSHing into the host and typing manually.\r\n3. We'd have to write a script for installing Neovim. We want it to be reliable enough to not warrant any manual intervention. This is a **tall** order. Consider the sheer varierty of targets: you have Linux targets that use `glibc`, `musl`, ancient kernels, different BSDs, Windows, mingw, MacOS. All of them with their own quirks. Differences in Neovim dependencies might introduce subtle bugs that are basically impossible to debug.\r\n4. You would also have to bootstrap the installation somehow. `curl` might be not present on the target, and so can `bash`. The package manager varierty is also quite gigantic. You would have to handle A LOT of platforms to bootstrap the Neovim installation.\r\n5. Plugins are pretty ad-hoc. Some of them depend on some runtime (LSPs are a great example), some require packages to be installed on the host, some require fonts (basically every plugin that wants Nerd Fonts). You are usually expected to handle it yourself, but it doesn't mesh well with automation. And then, a lot of plugin managers support version pinning but don't enforce it by default, so you could easily get a different version of a plugin installed which would cause unexpected problems. And then some plugins also have their internal update mechanism (LSP servers, Treesitter), which can also explode on you.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Better approach\r\n1. We should use local Neovim for everything. That way we are sure that everything works, and it doesn't require extra effort.\r\n2. We mount remote files locally, and open them in Neovim. SSHFS is one way to do it, but it's unmaintained and problematic. I suggest rclone - [it supports remote mounting](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/). It does a lot of what we'd like to have itself, it's reasonably efficient, it caches files locally (which means that if you experience a disconnect - you can continue your work) and it comes with a very nice perk of supporting a lot of cloud providers. Maybe you are storing JSONs or JS files on S3 - you can redact them with Neovim seamlessly! This is actually better than what VSCode can offer.\r\n3. We'd have to sync the changes. Rclone has commands and settings for syncing changes: you could set it to sync changes every 5 seconds, and do it in background asynchronously. You would likely have to auto-write changes to local filesystem in Neovim just before that, which should be fine. This can be made reasonably efficient and nice to use if you play around with the settings, you'd be able to handle disconnects too. Rclone also lets you resolve conflicts!\r\n\r\n# Prior work\r\nhttps://github.com/ipod825/vim-netranger - implements a file manager that also can use `rclone`. This is basically what we want.\r\nhttps://github.com/DanielWeidinger/nvim-sshfs - implementation with SSHFS",

I guess that could be used to always prefer the local `.git` over the remote one, which would introduce its own set of issues, but I don't think git-related issues are avoidable anyway. Git really works quite poorly with file synchronization.\r\n\r\nI think that's more of a UI issue, though. I'd imagine you'd be able to make a local checkout if you have remote access to the machine that has the repository, no? In that case, it would be much better to just avoid this remote dance altogether and `git clone` locally.",

What we have in neovim natively is:\r\n\r\n- Communication over `scp://` using `netrw` which gives a **local everything** approach. Buffer is cached locally making it \"snappy\" even with high network latency, `:Lexplore` would show the remote files. The problem is, things like LSP, integrated `:terminal` and `:!` commands do not work.\r\n- Using `nvim --remote-ui --server` or `neovide --server` option is a **remote everything** approach. It works with some semi-automation as shown above, until someone makes a plugin to make this truly effortless and cross-platform. It does not have the downsides of `netrw` (LSP, terminal and commands works) but everything is synchronous. It works only with a good network and is painful to use over network with high latency.\r\n\r\nPeople have mentioned VScode remote-ssh and Emacs TRAMP. Another tool which works well remotely out of the box is **JupyterLab**  because it was always built with a client-server model. The buffers are cached in the client's browser and everything is executed in the server.",

So yes you can! :smile:\n\n> The security implications of SSH are also very well understood while distant would be something entirely new that users would have to understand.\n\nFair enough. Distant uses a very modern encryption and authentication standard on par with ssh, but it definitely isn't battle tested or audited, although the crypto libraries have been audited. \n\n\nBut advanced functionality like running a file watcher for remote changes, translating language server file references such that it can work on the remote machine, remote filesystem searching, and persistent connections (like eternal terminal) are implemented using distant.\n\nRegardless, using it as a client library would give you a high level abstraction for file io and process execution, rather than needing to work with ssh and the sftp subsystem.\n\nAs distant implements support for other remote platforms, neovim would also get it for free.\n\nSo I'm not necessarily sold on limiting to ssh. We've seen the wonders that Lua had over vim script! :smile:",

            "body": "I want to add some brainstorming thoughts to this discussion to focus on what a real implementation of this for Neovim would actually look like. Continuing where @ashwinvis left off, what is the middle ground between \"local everything\" and \"remote everything\"? I'll call this the \"hybrid remote editing\" approach. The goal of this is to act like \"remote everything\", but where config is local and the UI isn't dependent on the network.\r\n\r\n- All UI needs to be rendered locally. Buffers need to be available and edited locally. Swapfiles are local. This part looks just like using netrw.\r\n- All filesystem access and process execution needs to happen remotely. Effectively, nvim should think that it's running on the remote system. This would mean that `!` filters would be remote, all language server integrations would be remote, `:terminal`, `:cd`, etc. Also, environment variables should all come from the remote host.\r\n- For simplicity, I think the entire neovim process only exists in one editing context. To start a hybrid remote editing session, you would invoke nvim with a flag that enables it. This avoids a lot of headaches around mixing contexts, and is also how VS Code implements this.\r\n\r\nHow could we actually implement this? I think the best way is to give add a new concept of \"location\" to vim. The initial \"location\" is \"default\". While this location is active, all operations (FS, process execution, environment) work exactly as if they were performed on the remote machine.\r\n\r\nThere should be some APIs to change the location to \"local\", like `:local COMMAND` to run a command with a local location, a Lua API to use the local location for the duration of a function call, etc (I think a variety of these will be necessary). While the local location is set, operations work as they do today (e.g. they run in the context of the machine vim is running on).\r\n\r\nThe default location works like a sandbox that only has some specific escape hatches. This means that existing scripts that aren't location-aware can continue to work unaffected: as far as they can tell, they are running on the remote editing host. But new scripts will be able to \"escape\" with the local location (an example: opening a URL in the user's browser requires executing a process in the local location).\r\n\r\nA quick \"user story\": Imagine running `ssh user@myhost -L 4000:localhost:4000` and then `cd path/to/folder && nvim --hybrid-remote-editing-listen=4000`, then opening a new terminal and starting `nvim --hybrid-remote-editing=localhost:4000`. Neovim starts as usual with your local init files, and `:pwd` reports that you are in `/home/user/path/to/folder`. If you `:e index.ts`, nvim finds and loads the appropriate `ftplugin` in the (local) `vimruntimepath`. Some script decides to run a linter, which will run on the remote host, resulting in some signs being applied to the buffer. When you run `:terminal`, the prompt is `user@myhost ~/path/to/folder` and it is running remotely. When you turn off wifi, you can continue to move around the buffer, but async jobs (like the linter) never finish and sync commands like `:w` hang nvim.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n- What APIs are covered under the \"location\" concept? The goal of the default location is to effectively trick any user command or script that isn't \"location-aware\" that it's actually running on the remote system.\r\n- What internal changes need to be made location-aware? Two obvious ones: init scripts and swap files.\r\n- In this proposal, the `:source` builtin and all other script evaluation happens in the local location. This side-steps the security concerns, but it may be desirable to add a separate API to enable sourcing remote files.\r\n- This proposal does not talk about installation of neovim on the remote at all. I think this is outside the scope of core. If Neovim provides an API to \"restart in a hybrid remote editing context\", then a script can implement this behavior itself.",
