(Looking at [the roadmap](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25696), I think that these should be supported under \"nested placeholders.\")\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\nnvim --clean foo.txt\n:lua vim.snippet.expand(\"$TM_FILENAME: ${1:$TM_FILENAME}\")\n```\n\nThis yields `foo.txt: |` (where `|` is the cursor), but it should yield `foo.txt: foo.txt` (with the second `foo.txt` selected).\n\n```\nnvim --clean foo.txt\n:lua vim.snippet.expand(\"$TM_FILENAME: ${1:${TM_SELECTED_BASE}}\")\n```\n\nThis yields `foo.txt: |` (where `|` is the cursor), but it should yield `foo.txt: foo` (with `foo` selected). (This one also seems to get neovim confused about when to consider the snippet finished. There's wonky behavior with tabbing.)\n\n\n```\nnvim --clean\n:lua vim.snippet.expand(\"$TM_FILENAME: ${1:${TM_FILENAME:placeholder}}\")\n```\n\nThis yields `: |` (where `|` is the cursor), but it should yield `: placeholder` (with `placeholder` selected). (This one has the same problem with tabbing as the second example.)\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSee above in the steps to reproduce. (It seemed easier to interleave the examples and expectations.)\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.0-dev-165+g054a287db\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo such thing in vim\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14.5\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGhostty 237343f4\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from repo",
