Then usually on subsequent DirChange events you do send didChangeConfiguration when you navigate between the workspace folders.\n\nDont know what is the feeling about handling some nuances of the multiple workspace folder support part of the spec, in core, but we have had this discussion in the past in the nvim-lspconfig repo.
