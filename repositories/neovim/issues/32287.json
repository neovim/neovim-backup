The documentation for `on_new_config` is:\n\n> Function executed after a root directory is detected. Used to modify the server configuration (including `cmd` itself).\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nref https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3597#issuecomment-2628425734\n\n> This could be another application for an autocmd that triggers just before the client starts.

All of the cases where I have used `on_new_config` seem to be dynamically building the command used to execute the language server. This is useful in a few places specifically:\n\n- Dynamically building the command line arguments passed to start the server\n  - some language servers use command line flags to pass in configuration files if they aren't super good at following the configuration options in the LSP spec\n  - cases where java is used to execute the language server there are a ton of flags for the jvm runtime that can be built dynamically to properly link libraries/configure memory requirements/etc.\n- Some languages with virtual environments you may want to detect in some way if there is a different location for the command binary and fill that in accordingly\n\nNot that this is necessarily an argument for or against `on_new_config`, there could be a better formalization that also covers cases like these",

I have a project that has submodules and each submodule needs its own set of packages and python versions. Maybe this is not an example for why we need `on_new_config` but it did take me a minute to figure out why my setup was not working and how to change it.\n\n```\non_new_config = function(client, dir)\n\n    -- Set python path to the first python executable found in the current directory or its parents\n    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ \"BufEnter\" }, {\n      -- group = lsp_buffer_group,\n      buffer = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf(),\n      callback = function()\n        local venv = vim.fs.root(dir, { '.venv', '.envrc', 'requirements.txt', 'pyproject.toml', 'ruff.toml', '.ruff.toml', '.git' })\n        local hits = vim.fs.find( { 'python' }, { limit = math.huge, path = venv } )\n        local result = vim.iter(hits)\n          :fold({ min_length = nil, min_str = nil },\n          function(acc, str)\n            if acc.min_length == nil or #str < acc.min_length then\n              acc.min_length = #str\n              acc.min_str = str\n            end\n            return acc\n          end)\n\n        if result.min_str == nil then\n          vim.notify( 'Could not find python path for ' .. dir, vim.log.levels.WARN )\n          return\n        end\n\n        client.settings.python = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', client.settings.python, { pythonPath = result.min_str } )\n      end,\n    })\n  end,\n```\n\nI stopped using `nvim-lspconfig` in favor of `vim.lsp` and now I can do the same with `on_attach`. Full example bellow:\n\n```\n{\n  single_file_support = true,\n\n  filetypes = {\"python\"},\n  cmd = {\"pyright-langserver\", \"--stdio\"},\n\n  root_markers = {\".venv\", \"requirements.txt\", \"pyproject.toml\", \"ruff.toml\", \".ruff.toml\", \".git\"},\n\n  settings = {\n    pyright = {\n      disableOrganizeImports = true, -- Ruff\"s\n    },\n    python = {\n      analysis = {\n        ignore = {\"*\"}, -- Ruff\"s\n        autoSearchPaths = true,\n        diagnosticMode = \"openFilesOnly\",\n        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true,\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  on_attach = function(client, bufnr)\n    local function update_python_path()\n      local dir = vim.fn.expand(\"%:p:h\")\n      local root = vim.fs.find(\n        { \".venv\", \".envrc\", \"requirements.txt\", \"pyproject.toml\", \"ruff.toml\", \".ruff.toml\", \".git\" },\n        { path = dir, upward = true, stop = vim.fn.expand(\"~\"), limit = 1 }\n      )[1]\n\n      local hit = vim.fs.find(\n        { \"python\" },\n        { path = root, upward = false, type = \"link\", ignore = function(_, _) return false end, limit = 1 }\n      )[1]\n      or vim.fn.trim(vim.fn.system(\"which python\"))\n\n      client.config.settings.python = vim.tbl_deep_extend(\"force\", client.config.settings.python, { pythonPath = hit })\n\n      client.notify(\"workspace/didChangeConfiguration\", { settings = { python = client.config.settings.python } })\n    end\n\n    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"BufEnter\", { buffer = bufnr, callback = update_python_path })\n    update_python_path()\n  end,\n}\n\n```\n\nInterestingly, the first version that is based on `nvim-lspconfig` and `on_new_config` would append the newly found `.venv` as a workspace to the same pyright whereas the `vim.lsp` and `on_attach` spawns a new pyright for each `.venv`.",

I've been using it for quite some time and it's working for me without any issues. The plugin allows to spawn LSP server inside a devcontainer while Neovim is running on the host (outside of container). It then wraps `config.cmd` by ([using its function form with RPC dispatchers](https://github.com/jedrzejboczar/devcontainers.nvim/blob/112f52fe966c795c6a095bc83b743dcfc5e56fcb/lua/devcontainers/lsp/rpc.lua#L275)) and performs URI path mapping between host and container in LSP messages. It uses LSP [metaModel.json](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#metaModel) (provided along LSP specification) to find all message types that container URIs and to find all places (\"paths\") in messages where URI can exist, this way it can efficiently and reliably translate the URIs. This is also described [here](https://github.com/jedrzejboczar/devcontainers.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#-design).\n\nNow, I use `on_new_config` for multiple things, [here is the on_new_config implementation](https://github.com/jedrzejboczar/devcontainers.nvim/blob/112f52fe966c795c6a095bc83b743dcfc5e56fcb/lua/devcontainers/init.lua#L17). The most important \"feature\" of `on_new_config` is that it is running in a Lua coroutine. This way my plugin can check if the devcontainer is already running and [spawn it](https://github.com/jedrzejboczar/devcontainers.nvim/blob/112f52fe966c795c6a095bc83b743dcfc5e56fcb/lua/devcontainers/init.lua#L40) if needed. This delays start of LSP server until the container is ready.\n\nI would like to convert my plugin configuration to the new LSP config but I am not sure if it is possible to do without the `on_new_config` handler (specifically the part where we wait with LSP start until devcontainer is running).",

The benefit of the `lspconfig` approach was that I never had to be aware of the language server's command. I could just do it for all language servers, by just extending their commands. This is great for lazy people, like me. With the current way to configure language servers, I'm left with just copy/pasting the `cmd` field from all the configs. It doesn't help that the programmatic API for `lspconfig` is deprecated, which I think is for the best anyway.\n\nFor those who might be wondering why I would wrap language server commands using `systemd-run`, this has the benefit of viewing language server logs through `journalctl(1)` if Neovim ever gains the ability to allow users to configure where the logs go, and not to `vim.fn.stdpath(\"state\")/lsp.log`.\n\nI believe my use case would be covered by the proposal using the following code:\n\n```lua\nvim.lsp.config(\"*\", function(config, callback)\n  config.cmd = wrap_in_systemd_run(config.cmd)\n  callback(config)\nend)\n```\n\nI thought I would log my use case to help design considerations for when/if the proposal makes it to a release.",
