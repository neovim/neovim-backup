The number '50' at the end is the priority in the editor list. Higher number means higher priority.\r\n\r\nNow let's see our list of editors:\r\n```shell\r\nsudo update-alternatives --config editor\r\n``` \r\nYou will be prompted to choose the default editor. You should see nvim. Choose the one with manual mode.\r\n\r\n**Now you can open any read-only file with `sudo -e filetoedit` command and save with `:w` in NeoVim!**\r\n\r\n",
