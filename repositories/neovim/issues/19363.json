Clients (mostly qui) has to execute a \":qa\" command in order to securely quit without data loss (for example user closed window using mouse but there are unsaved changes in some files) and there is no event that reports it is safe to quit. What I want is an ```nvim_try_quit``` (or similar name) api function which does same thing with \":qa\" and a way to tell to the client that neovim is closed itself.\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/go-client/issues/139",
