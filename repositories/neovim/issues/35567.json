Besides expanding the deployment scenarios for Nvim, this also would help us shape the story for a VFS (virtual filesystem), which is useful for other purposes (such as remote-ssh).\n\n## Expected behavior\n\n- Add a build task that produces a `nvim` artifact (emscripten, WASM/webassembly) that can run fully in-browser. \n- Add this build to our CI matrix.\n\n## Reference\n\n- working proof of concept: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19863#issuecomment-1694325623\n- https://github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm",
