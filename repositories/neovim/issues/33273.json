Because the [release page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.11.0) says, in the \"Linux (x86_64)\" section:\n\n> If your system does not have the [required glibc version](https://neovim.io/doc/user/support.html#supported-platforms), try the (unsupported) [builds for older glibc](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases).\n\nNote that \"required glibc version\" links to that same \"supported platforms\" section of the docs that you've just pointed out to be relevant for the source code only.\n\nThree suggestions:\n\n1. Don't link to the \"supported platforms\" section of the docs from the release page if it's not relevant for it at all.\n2. List the actual required version on the release page, or link to somewhere people can find this information.\n3. Add a note to \"[supported platforms](https://neovim.io/doc/user/support.html#supported-platforms)\" that emphasizes that these are the requirements for _building_ Neovim, not for running a binary release.\n\nI'm using Linux for 20 years or something, and even I didn't see any indication that the requirements, linked from the release page, are irrelevant for the binary releases.",

That is wrong and misleading. \n\n> > and support.txt still has no indication that these are the requirements for building Neovim, not running binary releases.\n> \n> It seemed kinda obvious to me tbh, because `support.txt` is unrelated to the binaries. I suppose it can't hurt to add a footnote in `support.txt` about this.\n\nI'm not understanding how support.txt is unrelated to the binaries, and I'm not understanding how it is obvious. The requirements seem to be for binaries as well to me.  The directions say:\n> #### Tarball\n>1. Download nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n> 2. Extract: tar xzvf nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n> 3. Run ./nvim-linux-x86_64/bin/nvim\n\nI'm on glibc 2.31 and cannot run that binary (./nvim-linux-x86_64/bin/nvim).  Trying to use [the unsupported builds ](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases/releases) does not even work because of glibc versions. The unsupported build .deb gives me :\n```\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of neovim:\n neovim depends on libc6 (>= 2.34); however:\n  Version of libc6:amd64 on system is 2.31-0ubuntu9.18.\n```\n\nIf `glibc >= 2.12 ` in support.txt is supposed to accurately reflect build requirements, to me it seems like an inaccurate use to include it in all of the built binaries. It makes more sense for support.txt to be about running the binaries, and a different doc in the source code to be for building.  support.txt is either misused and misleading or incorrect.\n\n\n\nThat Tarball instruction section in Installation should just be removed anyway. If it assumes the user knows what to do with the content inside the tarball, its fair to assume the existence of the download link for the tarball itself is clear enough, given its from the Releases page. Or go in a direction of actually guiding less-technical people in a \"Installation\" section.",
