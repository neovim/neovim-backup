Because the [release page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.11.0) says, in the \"Linux (x86_64)\" section:\n\n> If your system does not have the [required glibc version](https://neovim.io/doc/user/support.html#supported-platforms), try the (unsupported) [builds for older glibc](https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases).\n\nNote that \"required glibc version\" links to that same \"supported platforms\" section of the docs that you've just pointed out to be relevant for the source code only.\n\nThree suggestions:\n\n1. Don't link to the \"supported platforms\" section of the docs from the release page if it's not relevant for it at all.\n2. List the actual required version on the release page, or link to somewhere people can find this information.\n3. Add a note to \"[supported platforms](https://neovim.io/doc/user/support.html#supported-platforms)\" that emphasizes that these are the requirements for _building_ Neovim, not for running a binary release.\n\nI'm using Linux for 20 years or something, and even I didn't see any indication that the requirements, linked from the release page, are irrelevant for the binary releases.",
