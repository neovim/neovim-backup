Higher than default but lower than Telescope\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim\r\nSimilar application as LSP\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify\r\nIn the realm of `message scrollback` which has a value of `200`.

Must\r\n            be larger than zero. The following screen elements have hard-coded z-indices:\r\n            • 100: insert completion popupmenu\r\n            • 200: message scrollback\r\n            • 250: cmdline completion popupmenu (when wildoptions+=pum) The default value for\r\n              floats are 50. In general, values below 100 are recommended, unless there is a good\r\n              reason to overshadow builtin elements.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposal (WIP)\r\n\r\n| Index | Description |\r\n|----|----|\r\n| `0-49` | Buffer related elements |\r\n| `50-99` | Window related elements (this includes the default) |\r\n| `100-199` | ???
