    "body": "### Problem\n\nWith a simple `init.vim` configuration I end up with the cursor flickering at a decent frequency when opening netrw to navigate folders. This makes using netrw difficult because when the cursor flickers it also ignores user input, therefore making navigating a hassle. It's also visually unpleasing.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nStart neovim with the following configuration:\n```vimscript\nset clipboard=unnamedplus\nlet g:netrw_banner=0\n```\nThen launch neovim and once inside open netrw with `:Ex`.\nYou should now have a flickering cursor that makes moving around a pain.\nCommenting out any of those two lines in the configuration solves the issue, as well as pressing `I` while having netrw open (it restores the netrw banner).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe cursor should not flicker and user input shouldn't be ignored.\nThe expected behavior is the same as when having the netrw banner open, or a configuration file that doesn't have those 2 lines at the same time.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno (had to launch vim withouth flags), vim 9.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian unstable\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ngnome-terminal 3.58.0-1 \n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm\n\n### Installation\n\napt",
