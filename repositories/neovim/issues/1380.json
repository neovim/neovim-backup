There are parts of the codebase that are still mostly uncharted territory. It usually takes separating a feature you think might use what you want to replace (autocommands might be a good start), and following the code up and down until you get a good picture. Stepping through it in a debugger sometimes helps a lot too :).\n",

            "body": "Some updates:\nI've been investigating the best way to do this and this is what I've come up so far:\n- vim checks whether writing is going to conflict in a lot of different ways. Sometimes the check is done in place(like in `buf_check_timestamp()`), sometimes it's delegated to helper functions like `check_overwrite()`.\n  Note that those two functions are not the same thing, but one could ask if all these checks scattered all over the place could be somehow simplified. I came to the conclusion that this is just too much work, and leaving them there for the time being would not conflict with a notification feature.\n- Libuv provides file system events; the specific function is `uv_fs_event_start()`, but there could be some problems with this function: <br>\n  1) On virtual filesystems, like virtualbox shared folders, `uv_fs_event_start()` doesn't work properly. There's an option to circumvent this and use stat informations instead of the OS notification system, but it's currently not implemented in libuv.<br>\n  2) `uv_fs_event_start()` accepts the path to be watched as an argument; it could be a file(ideal in our case, as we would attach a watcher to a buffer as soon as it's opened) or a directory. \n  Unfortunately, uv_fs_event_start doesn't work at all if the file being watched is edited by vim: see https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/1585<br>\n  I discussed the issue with indutny after he had closed it, and while this behaviour makes sense from an implementation POV, because the inode descriptor watched is invalid, the function signature leads one to think that libuv is going to watch the path, independently of what happens to the file.\n\nAnother sore point highlighted by the issue is that the vim mechanism to save a file is overly complicated. If I edit the file with nano I just get one edit notification as expected, with vim I get, besides the edit notification, three(!) rename notification.\nI wanted to figure out the reason for this before reopening the issue, but the code that saves a buffer is tremendously complicated:\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/fileio.c#L2247\n`buf_write` are 1551 lines of totally unreadable and unmantainable code. The backup mechanism badly needs a rewrite.\n\nIf the issue with libuv cannot be solved, there are two possible workarounds:\n- listens for events coming from the path where the file is located; this always works, but filtering all the events is not very elegant and could turn out to be problematic in performance if the dir contains files that are written very frequentely.\n- Use a code similar to that of `buf_check_timestamp()`, but run asynchronously in a loop. This is possibly even more inelegant than the previous solution, but would work on virtual filesystems as bonus.\n",

I had a structure like this:\n\n`a/b/c.json`\n\nI moved `b/` into `a/new/`, so the new path was `a/new/b/c.json`, and when I attempt to write the file, (n)vim just breaks saying it can't write the file. I had to yank its contents, open the new location for the file, and paste the contents in there.\n\nI'd like my editor to be smart about all of these potential changes, but it was especially egregious that it broke considering I moved it _with NERDTree_, inside vim. CtrlP also failed to update in response to the move, trying to open path that no longer existed.\n\nI much prefer Atom's behavior, which is to always and immediately reflect the current state of the file system in the editor (except unsaved contents of files, but I use save-on-focus-lost).\n\nThanks all who are working on this. I'd like to contribute but I am fairly incompetent at C.\n",

So, for example, it writes to a different filename, so that if some disk error occurs and vim then crashes, the original file is left unmodified. After saving, it then renames the new file to overwrite the original. This is an atomic filesystem operation, so should either entirely succeed, or leave the original file unmodified again.\n\nI don't know how it ends up with _three_ move operations though.\n",

If you are going to compare sha256sum, you need to do it regularly which wastes resources whereas the OS can notify you instead of a file change (and the notification can be too late if you set a high time interval).\r\n\r\nHence relying on tools like watchman should be better.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty with vim is that it moves files around before saving them as described in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1380#issuecomment-258718813 so working with a plugin first to prototype and get a feel for the required changes and tools (watchman vs entr etc) sounds good.\r\n",

There's an option to circumvent this and use stat informations instead of the OS notification system, but it's currently not implemented in libuv.\r\n- File notifications may be useful for LSP: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/5522#issuecomment-269580090\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n- Use `vim.loop.new_fs_event()` implicitly for 'autoread'.

We probably should use (\"vend or depend\") a proven tool to deal with file-watcher edge cases.\r\n\r\n## Third-party tools\r\n\r\n- sunjon ([and lewis6991](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23291#issuecomment-1632855972)) mentioned https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch which also works on Windows.\r\n- [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr) (no Windows support)\r\n- https://facebook.github.io/watchman/\r\n- https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec\r\n\r\n## Edge cases (from the \"entr\" readme)\r\n\r\n>  it aims to be simple enough to create a new category of ad hoc automation. ...  a tool that is tuned for one task. \r\n>\r\n> inotifywait is lightweight, but it only works on Linux, and does not provide a direct means of saying “run this command if any of these files change”. In practice scripting with inotify-tools is difficult because there are a number of significant conditions to contend with:\r\n> 1. Many applications attempt to make the file save operation atomic by writing a new file and then removing the original. entr deals with this by closing the old file descriptor and reopening it using the same pathname. Since there is a small delay while the new file is renamed, we must wait for the new file to appear before running the supplied command and attempting to watch the new file.\r\n> 2. File change events that occur while the utility is running need to be processed so as to ensure that files that have been replaced are monitored, but these events should not trigger an execution when the child process ends. entr allows you to safely edit files while tests are running without a repeated invocation of the utility.\r\n> 3. Typically version control software will often update a series of files in rapid succession. Ideally the build is launched when then entire operation is complete. To cope with this behavior entr repeatedly probes for subsequent events, and only executes the utility when the kernel returns with no results after a short timeout.\r\n> 4. The events reported when saving files on an NFS mount are different than those of a local file system. On Linux an inotify may report IN_MOVE_SELF|IN_DELETE_SELF instead of IN_MODIFY|IN_CLOSE_WRITE and on BSD kqueue may report NOTE_RENAME|NOTE_DELETE instead of NOTE_WRITE|NOTE_EXTEND.\r\n> 5. A race condition exists when executing a script that is also under watch since a script cannot be executed while another process has it open for write. Rather than allowing the enigmatic error “Text file busy”, entr retries the execution.\r\n> 6. On Linux editors that use the Gnome's GIO may write to a file and then subsequently delete it. To deal with this entr consolidates events over 50ms before responding.\r\n> 7. In some cases an editor will rename a file without removing it. This occurs the first time a file is saved in Vim if the backup option is set. To deal with this events must be explicitly unregistered to prevent the kernel from tracking changes to backup files.",

(In fact I even found a (very minor) dead if condition check in `buf_write`.) I'd be more than willing to help in fixing it.\r\n\r\nCurrently nvim tries to check only for timestamp changes while writing a file, which is done through `check_mtime` which explains #7959. Calling `buf_check_timestamp` in place of `check_mtime` fixes the issue. (Although I don't know if it would be a \"neat\" solution.)\r\n\r\nThe other checks are done through `buf_check_timestamp` , which is called via `check_timestamps` in `ex_checktime` (when `:checktime` is executed), and some helper functions like `buf_contents_changed`, `bufIsChanged` and so on. \r\n\r\nI think `check_overwrite`, as the name suggests, checks for if it is okay to overwrite the current file. (eg. if the swapfile already exists.)\r\n\r\nI was looking into tools like [fswatch](https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/), [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) and [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and I thought of giving fswatch a try.\r\n\r\n@teto, @justinmk Any updates on if `vim.loop.new_fs_event()` works on windows? Also why was the idea of using fswatch or some other tool dropped? Upon reading about the limitations of fswatch, I don't think the problem of virtual file systems appears there, but I do not know how efficient it would be, especially if multiple files are open. (Which generally is true for me.)\r\n\r\nHow should I progress further with this? Should I try implementing a plugin using fswatch? Or should I look into  `vim.loop.new_fs_event()`?",
