    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nThe `mksession` command is used to save a \"session\"[^1], which includes, but isn't limited to, the buffers that are currently open, so that they can be restored by the `-S` option at a later time. The problem is that the *order* of these buffers in your session is not actually preserved by `mksession` or honored by `nvim -S`. For example, suppose the buffers in your session looks as follows:\r\n\r\n| file1.py | file2.py | file3.rs\r\n| :--- | :--- | :---\r\n\r\nYou use the `mksession` command to save it and then you exit, but when you use `nvim -S` to restore your session, you typically end up with a different buffer ordering; e.g.:\r\n\r\n| file3.rs | file1.py | file2.py\r\n| :--- | :--- | :---\r\n\r\n(The above is just one possibility and should not be interpreted as implying that it would predictably end up that way.)\r\n\r\nI recall seeing an issue where some comments explained why changing buffer orderings *after* they had been created wasn't possible or desirable[^2], which, AFAIK, means that, to change buffer ordering, the only available option is for the user to close the buffers and manually re-open them in the desired order. This isn't a great user experience, IMO, especially when you work with lots of files at a time. (Note: This is about helping users keep their workspaces organized, not about trying to find open buffers.)\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is due to `mksession` not *preserving* buffer order when it creates the `Session.vim` file in the first place or `nvim -S` not *respecting* these data when reading the `Session.vim` file to restore the user session.\r\n\r\nThe `sessionoptions` in the docs don't seem(?) to have a value that would enable, control, and/or imply the proposed behavior. Supposing, *arguendo*, that this is feasible, perhaps this behavior could either: be implied by an existing value, or be handled by a new one?\r\n\r\nFor completeness' sake I'm using the `snap` package of `nvim`, version `0.9.4`, so, if this behavior is already in some kind of roadmap for a future release, I'd appreciate being pointed to it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n**PS:** [This issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28297) may or may not be related to this.\r\n\r\n[^1]: I may be using some terms, like \"session\", here a bit loosely, but I hope what I mean is clear from context.\r\n\r\n[^2]: ~May've been related to buffer number/IDs and plugins, IIRC. Either way, the relevant point is that users can't reorder buffers, not the underlying cause.~ See [this issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7558).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior would be for the buffer ordering in sessions restored by `nvim -S` to match the order they had when the `mksession` command was used to save it. For example, the buffer ordering below should be preserved/respected when saving/restoring sessions with `mksession`/`nvim -S` respectively:\r\n\r\n| file1.py | file2.py | file3.rs\r\n| :--- | :--- | :---",
