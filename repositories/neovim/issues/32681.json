    "body": "### Problem\n\nRecent versions of Neovim have subtly altered how they handle the absolute path of files opened inside a symlinked directory, at least on Windows:\n- previously, the path of the newly opened file was relative to the symlink source\n- currently, the path of the opened file is relative to the symlink _target_\n\nThis is super problematic for a number of reasons: completely messes up my Perforce integration, breaks LSP (clangd) based navigation, can cause swapfile collision issues, and is a major pain in the ass in general, to the point where I simply cannot upgrade to newer versions at all as it is.\n\nI've traced this back to the changes introduced in version 0.10.1, version 0.10.0 does not show this behaviour. I've carefully scanned the published list of changes in that release, and the two that sound somewhat related to me seem to be https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28799 and https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28973.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nNavigate to the symlinked project dir: in my case let's say `C:\\prj` is symlinked to `D:\\prj`\n```\nC:\\prj> nvim --clean   <-- Open the session at the symlink *source*\n:pwd\n(outputs 'C:\\prj')\n:e build.bat\n:echo expand('%:p')\n(outputs 'C:\\prj\\build.bat')  <-- Note that for some reason the problem doesn't manifest at the project root level\n:e src\\main.cpp\n:echo expand('%:p')\n(outputs 'D:\\prj\\src\\main.cpp')\n```\nI've since reverted to 0.10.0, so I cannot fully confirm, but I'm pretty sure the output of :pwd remains unaltered throughout.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe absolute path of any open files in the project should remain relative to the CWD\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.1 to 0.10.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 8.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nCmder / Neovide\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nI dont have one\n\n### Installation\n\nUnzipped win64 .zip",
