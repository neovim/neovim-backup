I have once created a [plugin](https://bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/zvim) which added command `:ZEdit` (like `:e`, but with more zsh-like completion: I think fish designed its file name completion based on zsh experience), but am not really using it because Command-T performs better. (In description you may see that this is also plugin for better completion in zsh scripts, but it was an intention, feature was never added. Plugin was never published by me.)",
