    "body": "### Problem\n\nI have a broken tree-sitter query somewhere, which is broken on patch files. I can probably figure it out with sufficient use of grep, but the problem is much more frustrating to diagnose because the name of the query file is not in the traceback or error message, so I have no idea which language is actually at fault.\n\n```\nError executing vim.schedule lua callback: /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/query.lua:252: Query error at 1:3. Invalid node type \"comment\":\n((comment) @injection.content\n  ^\n\nstack traceback:\n        [C]: in function '_ts_parse_query'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/query.lua:252: in function 'fn'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/func/_memoize.lua:58: in function 'fn'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/func/_memoize.lua:58: in function 'get'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/languagetree.lua:128: in function 'new'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter.lua:41: in function '_create_parser'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter.lua:108: in function 'get_parser'\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter.lua:416: in function 'ts_highlighter'\n        .../start/telescope.nvim/lua/telescope/previewers/utils.lua:154: in function 'highlighter'\n        ...scope.nvim/lua/telescope/previewers/buffer_previewer.lua:233: in function ''\n        vim/_editor.lua: in function <vim/_editor.lua:0>\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHeavens I don't know. Screw up a query which is loaded by some kind of lua.
