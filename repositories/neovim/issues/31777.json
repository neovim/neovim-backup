Sometimes it will draw it correctly but the highlights go back to being incorrect on the next redraw(?)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nminimal.lua:\n\n```lua\nvim.treesitter.query.set(\n  'lua',\n  'injections',\n  [[((comment_content) @injection.content (#set! injection.self) (#set! injection.combined))]]\n)\n\nvim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, -1, false, {\n  '-- print([[some',\n  '-- text',\n  '-- here]])',\n})\nvim.bo.ft = 'lua'\n```\n\n```sh\nnvim --clean -u minimal.lua\n```\n\nObserve:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3de9396-f1c5-424b-9cd4-8ad22da6b023)\n\nWeird redrawing:\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e845f91-29fe-46ae-a3bd-617e2d8387cd\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIn the above example, `here]]` should also have a string highlight, and the final closing parenthesis should have a bracket highlight. Instead they are not parsed as injections.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-1422+g35247b00a4-dirty Build type: Debug LuaJIT 2.1.1734355927\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNA\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux 6.12.5 @ NixOS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.37.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from source",
