It also seems like this is something that has been discussed previously (see: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27339#discussion_r1583574488)\n\nI am opening this issue as I couldn't find a specific issue for this (sorry if there is one and I just couldn't find this).\n\nI spent some time now to see if I could figure out why and where this is happening, and I seem to have found a patch that could potentially fix this. I don't really know yet if this would break other things, and also why this was added as a guard in the first place.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/nvim/insexpand.c b/src/nvim/insexpand.c\nindex 84dd55fa7..bd83b376c 100644\n--- a/src/nvim/insexpand.c\n+++ b/src/nvim/insexpand.c\n@@ -1759,7 +1759,6 @@ int ins_compl_bs(void)\n   // Respect the 'backspace' option.\n   if ((int)(p - line) - (int)compl_col < 0\n       || ((int)(p - line) - (int)compl_col == 0 && !ctrl_x_mode_omni())\n-      || ctrl_x_mode_eval()\n       || (!can_bs(BS_START) && (int)(p - line) - (int)compl_col\n           - compl_length < 0)) {\n     return K_BS;\n```\n\nI could possibly be interested in trying to tackle this problem if it is wanted, and if so I am also going to try and upstream the solution to vim of course\n\nSo I guess my question is; is this an acceptable solution? If not, any pointers on where to start?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect it to still show the pum after backspace when using `complete()` just like how it works for omnifunc.\n\nBefore the patch:\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b1c8e8f-6e03-476d-aea6-997fd9ef5a8a\n\nAfter the patch:\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55af39ae-9b25-4ddd-ab7a-bc3b6e173562\n",
