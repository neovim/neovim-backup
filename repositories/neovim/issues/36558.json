So an arbitrary string is simply not enough, and trying to make this a enum will fall into the trap of caring too much about the structure of the item and not being a generic interface.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAdd a `preview` field with signature `fun(item, item_idx): buf`\n\nso a minimal buffer picker will look like:\n\n```lua\nvim.ui.select(vim.api.nvim_list_bufs(), {\n\tpreview = function(buf)\n\t\treturn buf\n\tend,\n\tformat_item = function(buf)\n\t\treturn vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(buf)\n\tend,\n}, function(buf)\n\tvim.cmd.buffer(buf)\nend)\n```\nThe advantage of this approach is that it `vim.ui.select` still don't need to know that it is rendering or the structure of the item, the caller decides whether they want to render a diff, a help file, a normal buffer, or a term buffer.\n\nI have tried adding support for this kind of simple preview field for the mainstream pickers, and they work pretty well, and are just minor changes, so I believe we can add this \"contract\", so that plugin authors will call `vim.ui.select` for 80% of the time, and not care about what handler the users are using.\n\nI can draft a PR if this makes sense.\n\np.s. Here's where I got the idea: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/35943#discussioncomment-14662365\nBut I have not found the discussions mentioned on how this relates to bringing `vim.ui` closer to LSP capabilities\n\np.s. `preview_item` might be a better name, to be more consistent with `format_item`, and it seems to be what `mini.pick` is using internally.",

The main idea is to document an interface through which `vim.ui.select` implementations can show more information about an item. Fuzzy pickers tend to name this \"item preview\".\n\nThe term `on_hover` can also be a thing (i.e. act on when an item is made \"current\" but not yet chosen), but this is not necessarily the same as a preview. Hovering on an item *might* result in its preview (if there are two windows with item list and preview), but it also might not (if preview window/content is shown on demand).\n\n['mini.pick' implementation of `vim.ui.select`](https://nvim-mini.org/mini.nvim/doc/mini-pick.html#minipick.ui_select) indeed respects the `opts.preview_item`, which can be `fun(item: any):string[]`. A more general signature might better be one of:\n1. `fun(buf: integer, item: any):nil` - preview modifies a given buffer with text and/or highlighting.\n2. `fun(item: any):integer` - preview itself creates a buffer with a previewed content and returns its id.\n\n---\n\nAgreeing and adding some sort of preview interface into `vim.ui.select` will indeed greatly help with plugins. Currently for a custom \"fuzzy select\" functionality plugin authors usually end up creating separate implementations for all popular (at the moment) pickers. Partly because `vim.ui.select()` is not *that* popularized, but I *think* mostly because it does not provide flexible enough interface. The `preview_item` option should be a great improvement here.",

            "body": "> Makes sense, but still wondering how does `vim.ui.select` know when to call the preview handler? Doesn't this imply the need for a hover/current hook?\n\nEach implementation can make its own decision. More or less similar to how `opts.format_item` is used: yes, it *can* use it inside some item list, or it can decide to use in some other fashion.\n\nThe `opts.preview_item()` can be used something like this:\n- When there is side-by-side preview, it is indeed called to setup content whenever \"current/active/selected item\" is changed. This is how `vim.ui.select` implementations based on current fuzzy pickers with default window layouts will probably use it.\n- When there is an on-demand preview, there is a separate key that is associated with \"show preview\". The `opts.preview_item` will be used then. This is how 'mini.pick' and layouts without side-by-side preview will use it.\n\nThe idea is to document an interface for both `vim.ui.select` users and implementations:\n- Users can have something like `opts.preview_item = functiion(buf_id, item) vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, 0, -1, false, vim.split(vim.inspect(item), '\\n')) end`.\n- Implementations can have something like `vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(preview_win_id, buf_id); opts.preview_item(buf_id, item)`.",
