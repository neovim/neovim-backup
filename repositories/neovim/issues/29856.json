Decided to open a separate issue here as it seems that implementation will be different and the Vim issue got stale.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAvailable either a `:restart` command or `vim.api.nvim_restart()` function which can restart an instance without \"close-reopen\" loop.\r\n\r\nThe effect is expected to be at least the same as (in layman language):\r\n- Do Neovim closing process as normal *but* stop just before actually terminating the process.\r\n- Execute startup sequence as if a new process has started. This can also result in preserving \"startup related\" data like argument list, CLI options, etc. Maybe even tabpages/windows/buffers for better interactive experience.\r\n\r\nI see this feature as useful in at least for following use cases:\r\n- Clean reloading of user config after there were some changes made.\r\n- Restarting instance through RPC without dealing with \"close and drop connection -> reopen with proper arguments -> reconnect\".",

Hence the \"needs:discussion\" label.\r\n- The benefit of available restart through RPC seems to be a valid argument for having it in core.\r\n- Suggestion to move this functionality to plugin (which are mostly meant to work *inside* current session) to me seems a bit far-fetched.",
