Then, install Firenvim [from source](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim#from-source) and run its testsuite (`npm run test`) a few times.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nNeovim eventually corrupts the shada file. I can only reproduce this by running the Firenvim testsuite (which starts and kills lots of neovim process very quickly) on a Windows VM (which is pretty slow). I know reproducing this would be a lot of effort so feel free to ask for more information, I'll be happy to run whatever steps need to be ran.\r\n\r\nUsing `-i NONE` is an acceptable workaround for my usecase.\r\n\r\nHere are two example corrupted shada directories: https://file.io/DpD6xJ\r\nhttps://file.io/J2daeD\r\nIn both cases, the error message is `E576: Error while reading ShaDa file: last entry specified that it occupies 99 bytes, but file ended earlier.`.",

And use `-i NONE` for (most?) tests where shada is not needed.",
