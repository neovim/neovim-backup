The [vim-gnupg](https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg) plugin uses this behaviour to allow transparent editing of GPG encrypted files.\n\nWhen you run the above command, Vim's :r will show something like this at the bottom of the window:\n\n```\nYou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for\nuser: \"User <user@email.com>\"\n4096-bit RSA key, ID 12345678, created 1970-01-01 (main key ID 12345678)\n\nEnter passphrase:\n```\n\nNaturally, the cursor is placed after \"Enter passphrase: \" so that you can enter your passphrase and decrypt the file. \n\nIn Neovim however, the message is printed but the cursor just disappears, and I have to kill the process to get back to a terminal.\n",
