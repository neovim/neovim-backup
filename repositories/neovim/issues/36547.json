    "body": "### Problem\n\n`vim.pack` currently uses `git clone --filter=blob:none --recurse-submodules --also-filter-submodules` to clone packages. `--also-filter-submodules` was introduced in git 2.36 which was [released in April 2022](https://github.com/git/git/releases/tag/v2.36.0). Thus, `vim.pack` requires git>=2.36. 2022 is not that long ago, and there are likely a lot of environments where just an older version of `git` is available. (I noticed this on a Ubuntu 22.04 machine, where [only git 2.34 can be installed from official sources](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy-updates/git).)\n\nFrom [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/36389#issuecomment-3467184543), it seems that both `--filter` and `--also-filter-submodules` especially are optimizations to speed up the cloning process. (`lazy.nvim` also used to clone with `--also-filter-submodules` but this [was deemed unnecessary and removed](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/issues/83#issuecomment-1362494095).) Perhaps this option can be omitted entirely, or just added when the available git is known to support them?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe built-in `vim.pack` should be compatible with as many git versions as possible. As a user, I'd like my configuration to work in as many environments as possible.",

(I noticed this on a Ubuntu 22.04 machine, where [only git 2.34 can be installed from official sources](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy-updates/git).)\n\nThree and a half years is a long time ago in terms of Git, Neovim, and Ubuntu development. The latest Git version is 2.51, which is 15 releases after 2.36. Also, the Ubuntu 22.04 is not even the latest LTS release while 24.04 contains compatible Git version.\n\nDropping the `--also-filter-submodules` for older Git versions is possible, but requires extra code that can not be (reasonably and reliably) tested and will become only more outdated as the time passes.\n\nDropping it completely is not really a good solution here given the conditions on why it should be dropped.\n\nSo unless other team members have opposite opinion, I'll close this as \"not really worth the churn\".",

But otherwise we really should not spend time on this.\n\nDropping a flag means dropping a feature (use blobless clone for submodules for smaller disk space and faster install). So the question is where the compromise should go:\n- Enable \"`vim.pack` works out of the box\" for users on default Ubuntu 22.04 who can't / won't update Git version.\n- Enable \"blobless clone for submodules\" for users of plugins with submodules (like LuaSnip).\n\nOne extra thing about removing this flag is that there is no clear guidelines/decision about when it is okay to add it again. It would be a different story if there were an official cutoff of \"this platform or OS version is not supported\". The closest thing is [`:h supported-platforms`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/support.html#supported-platforms) and it mentions \"Ubuntu 24.04\" as the tested version.\n\nI am still inclined to close this as not planned (for all reasons explained earlier; plus that this is documented). But it was not me who reopened it, so not really comfortable with closing it again.",

Is this okay to include in `vim.pack`? This is what [is done in `mini.deps`](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/dce9bc4e19d02d5c37fe71c16f40f8a5536b0386/lua/mini/deps.lua#L906-L909) (and was added when Ubuntu 22.04 was the latest LTS release), but I did not include it in `vim.pack` for the reasons I mentioned above.",
