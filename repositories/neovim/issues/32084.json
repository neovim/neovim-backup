Seeing the recent AI code pairing and a new product named \"Cursor\" I cam up with an idea which is synonymous with your issue.\n\nMy idea was to create a plugin that would read the user's codebase for context and provide solutions to the user just like how cursor does. and in order to keep it open source and free we can ask the User for their API Key and then use it to carry out AI communications. Another solution will be to do what \"pieces\" did we can take permission to run ollama and run an open source model in the background and the use port forwarding to implement the AI context and code suggestion feature.\n\nI am aiming to implement this as a part of GSOC contribution. if you are interested to give me a chance at it then please ping me up.",
