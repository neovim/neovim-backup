After a fraction of a second it disappears and the regular initial window contents appear.\r\n\r\nUsing a terminal to a remote Mac, I see `p$qm+q5463;524742;73657472676266;73657472676262$qm+q4D73` with the `$qm+q4D73` in dark italic.\r\n\r\nI didn't see this with 0.9.5.\r\n\r\nIt still does it with `nvim --clean`.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is due to DECRQSS terminal escapes that aren't implemented by macOS terminal. Apparently [they aren't implemented for alacritty either](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7184).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`nvim --clean`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nInitial `NVIM v0.10.0` blank window appears.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, 9.0.2142\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14.5\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nmacOS terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nHomebrew",

This is just Apple Terminal being terrible, as usual.\r\n\r\nWe disabled DECRQSS for Apple Terminal in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28453, but that won't work for a remote SSH session (the remote session doesn't know anything about the terminal emulator). We are also sendin XTGETTCAP and DECRQSS requests to determine truecolor support in `_defaults.lua`, where we don't have any guards for Apple Terminal.\r\n\r\nA workaround in the meantime is to set `COLORTERM=truecolor` in your remote environment and also use `set notermguicolors` in your init file. Setting `$COLORTERM` this way will prevent Nvim from querying the terminal (it will assume that the terminal does support truecolor), and then disabling `'termguicolors'` in your init file will disable it again.",
