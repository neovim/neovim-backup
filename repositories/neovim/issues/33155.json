I agree that it would be useful to have a formal specification -- and this is not meant to replace that -- but you can see what we use [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/master/src/nvim/vterm) (this is a cleaned-up vendored version of libvterm, which is otherwise a bit hidden away). \n\nFrom a brief look at https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/src/lib_vt.zig, libghostty ticks most of the boxes; the only thing missing is some [input handling](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/vterm/keyboard.c), mostly around paste handling.\n\nThe big desiderata over libvterm would be 1. robust line wrapping and 2. scrollback buffer handling.",
