    "body": "When running LSPs in a container that were made with [vscode-languageserver-node](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node), the processId is passed to the server and is periodically checked. If the PID passed to the language server no longer exists, the language server kills itself. This causes the language server to exit 3 seconds after neovim initializes the connection due to neovim's process not existing in the container.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this is to pass processId as `null` to the language server. This turns off checks that the client process is still running.\r\n\r\nThis is the current work around in neovim\r\n```lua\r\nvim.loop.getpid = function() return nil end\r\n```\r\nThis will then pass nil to processId when it reaches the `initialize_params` here (`uv` being `vim.loop`)\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8a93d1028f38c77d7ad8b4ad0a93dc11a5cbe85d/runtime/lua/vim/lsp.lua#L777-L821\r\nThis seems like a rather dangerous workaround depending on how `getpid` is used in other parts of neovim.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would rather be able to set the `processId` `initialization_param` like I would capabilities or rootUri.",
