What should happen when you re-open these two files along with another file C, all of that in a Vim instance too small to accommodate the width of even a single of these files? There are a lot of answers to this question and none of them is right in all situations/for everyone. And that's without entering into the details of multiple windows of different size displaying the same file.\r\n\r\nThe solution to your problem is indeed sessions, as @Sh3Rm4n pointed out. Instead of storing dimensions on a file-basis, you store the state of all windows/buffers and restore that. If there's a single file whose size you want to preserve, changing the size with a file-based autocommand could do the trick. The `:h equalalways` option might also be of interest.",
