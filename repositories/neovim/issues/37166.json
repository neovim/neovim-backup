    "body": "### Problem\n\nWe have basic support for dynamic registration, but there is work that needs to be done to allow for a more full-fledged support of all the options\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n# Registration Tracking\n### Problem:\nWe currently track registrations in a table keyed by method.\nThis is not really suitable, as some method registrations provide `RegistrationOptions` that correspond to other methods. Eg, `textDocument/diagnostic`'s registration provides items relevant to `workspace/diagnostic`.\n### Solution:\nTrack dynamic registrations in a table keyed by the `{Whatever}Provider` that the options relate to, e.g., `textDocument/diagnostic` would be tracked in `client.dynamic_capabilities.capabilities['diagnosticProvider']\n- #37161 \n\n# Supports_Method\n## Multiple Registrations\n### Problem:\nCurrently, `supports_method` will return the **first** registration. A server may register the same method multiple times, with different options. We should consider all options when looking for support\n### Solution:\nReplace `client.get_registration` with `client.get_registrations`. This will return an array of LSPRegistrations. This allows the caller, currently just `supports_method`, to iterate through all the registrations for support\n- #37161 \n\n## RegistrationOptions may dictate support for a method\n### Problem:\nCurrenly `supports_method` interprets the presence of a registration as meaning the method is supported. This is not correct as the `RegistrationOptions` may provide support/not support for other methods. Eg, the `WorkSpaceDiagnostics` field in a `textDocument/diagnostics` registration is what outlines support for `workspace/diagnostic`.\n### Solution:\nUse the existing `_request_name_to_server_capability` table to check the registration options for support\n- #37161\n\n# LSP attaching\n### Problem:\nAt the moment, the LSP client is attached purely based on FileType. A dynamic registration can provide a `globPattern` to match for events. This may be for a different filetype than the primary support of the LSP. e.g., `rust-analyzer` will register `textDocument/didSave` for `cargo.toml`.\n### Solution:\nAutocommands should be able to take a pattern in the form of ` { glob = 'xxxx' }` that will match an LSP glob as per `vim.glob`. This will allow for attaching the client to these files for tracking the correct events.\n\n# Capability Checking\n### Problem:\nSome handlers `vim.tbl_get` into `client.server_capabilities` to check for the existence of a `{Whatever}Provider`. This does not consider dynamic registrations\n### Solution:\nSome sort of helper function that also checks dynamic registrations\n\nCurrent Places identified (not exhaustive)\n- `text_document_did_save_handler`\n- on_type_formatting\n- _changetracking.lua - `get_group`\n- linked_editing_range\n- buf.lua - `signature_help`\n-  diagnostic.lua - `_workspace_diagnostic`\ngrep pattern:\n`vim.tbl_get\\(client, '`\n`vim.tbl_get\\(client.server_capabilities`",
