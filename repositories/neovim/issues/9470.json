The first thing `mkfifo` man page says is `make FIFOs (named pipes)`. Wikipedia confirms this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types). The unix `test` option `-p` which is described as \"FILE exists as is a named pipe\" returns true when run on something created by `mkfifo`. (And BTW does *not* return true for the kind of socket Neovim creates with the filename saved as `v:servername`.)\r\n\r\nAs near as I can tell, the Neovim documentation on channels overall, and on sockconnect() is misleading.\r\n\r\n",

As far as I can tell, neovim is the *only* project that uses \"named pipe\" to mean something birectional. As far as I can tell, \"full-duplex named pipe\" is a contradiction in terms. \r\n\r\nSo, I don't think you're leading by example. I think you're creating the confusion by calling the birectional sockets neovim supports \"named pipes\", when everyone else uses that phrase for something else.\r\n\r\nObviously, you can stick with the terminology you have if you want, but you are going to confuse people. You certainly confused me. \r\n\r\nI'm not even suggesting dropping \"pipe\" as one of the options for sockconnect(); that's done and too late to change now. But the documentation should make it clearer that it doesn't mean FIFOs.",
