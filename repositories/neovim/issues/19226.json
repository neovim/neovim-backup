    "body": "### Problem\n\n- Plugins cannot inspect folds\n- Custom folds require `foldexpr` which is inefficient as it requires evaluating this expression on every buffer line.\n\n### Solution\n\nAPI for plugins to set, inspect folds and get fold events.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Folds are window local and so are most of the folding related options.\n- Fold state (whether a fold is open/closed) is also local to the window.\n- ~Extmarks are buffer local.~ Can now be window local with `nvim__ns_set`.\n- Folds can be nested\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Add folding support to extmarks\n  - Add a new method to `'foldmethod'` named `extmark` so extmark folds cannot be mixed with other kinds of folds.\n  - When folds of calculated, we scan the extmarks for all the folds and store them in `win->w_folds`.\n  - The trigger for updating is the same as other foldmethods.\n- Add `nvim_win_add_fold` and `nvim_win_del_fold`. These new API functions are to be used instead of the `zf`/`zd` operators.\n  - _Should these functions work for all fold methods or just `manual`/`marker` like `zf` does?_\n\n  ```\n  nvim_win_add_fold({window}, {start}, {end}, {opts})\n      Add a fold to the window from {start} to {end}.\n\n      All row arguments are 0-indexed, inclusive.\n\n      Only supported for `foldmethod=manåual`\n\n      Parameters: ~\n          {window}  Window handle, or 0 for current window\n          {start}   Start row of fold.\n          {end}     End row of fold.\n          {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.\n\n  nvim_win_del_fold({window}, {start}, {end}, {opts})\n      Delete a fold from the window from {start} to {end}.\n\n      All row arguments are 0-indexed, inclusive.\n\n      Only supported for `foldmethod=manual`\n\n      Parameters: ~\n          {window}  Window handle, or 0 for current window\n          {start}   Start row of fold.\n          {end}     End row of fold.\n          {opts}    Optional parameters. Reserved for future use.\n\n  ```\n- Add `nvim_win_get_folds` for getting folds for any foldmethod.\n  ```\n  nvim_win_get_folds({window}, {opts})\n\n      All row arguments are 0-indexed, inclusive.\n\n      Parameters: ~\n          {window}  Window handle, or 0 for current window\n          {opts}    Optional parameters:\n                    - start_row: get folds from this row\n                    - end_row: get folds up to this row\n      Returns:\n\n      Array of dictionaries for each fold. Each elements has the keys:\n      - state: string, \"open\" | \"closed\"\n      - start_row: integer, start row of fold\n      - end_row: integer, end row of fold\n      - [FUTURE] start_col: integer\n      - [FUTURE] end_col: integer\n      - children: array of folds ????? SHOULD WE HAVE THIS?\n\n  ```\n\n- Add `nvim_win_toggle_folds` change the fold state of all folds in a region.\n  ```\n  nvim_win_toggle_folds({window}, {opts})\n\n      Parameters: ~\n          {window}  Window handle, or 0 for current window\n          {opts}    Optional parameters:\n                    - start_row: get folds from this row\n                    - end_row: get folds up to this row\n                    - action: \"toggle\", \"open\", \"close\". Default is \"toggle\".\n                      Note: for \"toggle\", only the first fold state is considered.\n                      E.g. if the first fold in the region is open, then all folds\n                      in the region will be closed.\n    ```\n- Add `nvim_win_attach` with an `on_fold` callback for detecting changes to folds.\n  ```\n  nvim_win_attach({window}, {opts})\n      Activates window-update events on a channel, or as Lua\n      callbacks.\n\n      Parameters: ~\n          {window}  Window handle, or 0 for current window\n          {opts}    Optional parameters:\n                    - on_fold: Lua callback invoked on change.\n                      Args:\n                      - the string \"fold\"\n                      - window handle\n                      - first line where folds where updated\n                      - last line where folds where updated\n                      - String \"add | del | update | open | close\"\n\n  ```\n\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\n- Column-aware folds (aka inline folds)\n\n### Questions\n\n- For nested folds, do we represent them as a flat list of locations or a nested structure?\n\n- ~Should we assign ID's and namespaces to folds?~\n  - EDIT: No as ID's/namespaces for folds will be achievable using extmarks which will be the preferred method for applying folds.\n\n### Related\n\n- Fold events: #8538\n- Window events: #8539\n\n",
