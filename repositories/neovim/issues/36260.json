This behaviour doesn't happen in vim or any other program that let's me paste from the clipboard. This issue only happens in windows. When testing on my macbook I cannot replicate it.\n\nI tried it with the latest stable release of neovim 0.11 and with v0.12.0-dev-1472+g 869e55f2aa which is the nightly version available in scoop for windows and they both have this issue\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim --clean\n:set clipboard=unnamedplus\n\n-- copy something from notepad without any newlines\n\n-- press p to paste a couple of times\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe content of the clipboard is added directly at the cursor position without any newlines being inserted before or after\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.12.0-dev-1472+g869e55f2aa\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20250730-195751-6a493f88\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nscoop",
