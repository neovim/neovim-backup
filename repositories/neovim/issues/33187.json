    "body": "Hi, thank you for the amazing work!\n\nWith 0.11 I'm seeing an increase of default bindings, which on one hand is nice, but on the other hand not so much, since they are highly opinionated (although carefully thought out). Now I have to deal with breaking config (mainly `gr` to go to definition in normal mode).\n\nI find myself active having to combat the default bindings. Please have an option to disable them _partially_. Some are nice, like `gc` /  `gcc` / `[<space>` / `]<space>`. So I would like a simple solution to disable less optimal (for me) ones. If more defaults come, we might have to combat these, too.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nHave a way to simply disable specific default bindings.",
