In such a huge project, `rust-analyzer` takes like 1-2 full minutes to initialize. For that reason, I don't want to kill Neovim to get back to the terminal, instead I want to leave Neovim open and either use a terminal buffer or a new tmux window or use `:sus` to get to my shell, so that I don't have to close and re-open Neovim, then wait 1-2 minutes for `rust-analyzer` to re-initialize.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? I'm open to alternative solutions, but this seems like a simple solution to me.",
