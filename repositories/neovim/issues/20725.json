This fails to work for `https` urls like `Github`.\n\nCan we add an option to let developers to use customized command such as `wget` or system's `curl` to download the dependencies in `ExternalProject_Add()`?\n\nFor example, we can add a customized `DOWNLOAD_COMMAND` that developer provides in `ExternalProject_Add`? Thanks",
