I'd personally love it if I could get new windows to open vertically by default.\r\n\r\nAnother big motivation for this is that plugins that generate many windows like [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) would greatly benefit from this.\r\n\r\nI think having to write `vs` or `vert` in front of every command is really annoying, and with the resolution and width of modern computer monitors it would only make sense to have this as a built-in option. I think it's odd that not even helpfiles open vertically by default these days since they always are around 80 characters wide, which leaves tons of unused screen space in a horizontal split on modern screens. I personally rarely use horizontal splits unless I already have loads of windows open already.\r\n\r\nI know there are workarounds but they all have their downsides. The one suggested by @justinmk is too general and forces all windows to be vertical, including when specifically telling the window to be horizontal. For helpfiles I currently use the following configuration as a workaround, but it doesn't work 100% of the time as I sometimes get weird behaviour because of it, for insance when clashing with plugins.\r\n\r\n```vim\r\naugroup vertical_help\r\n  autocmd!\r\n  autocmd FileType help\r\n        \\ setlocal bufhidden=unload |\r\n        \\ wincmd L |\r\n        \\ vertical resize 79\r\naugroup END\r\n```",
