This parser has several optional extensions; most of which are enabled by default (therefore available in neovim). However two are not: EXTENSION_TAGS and EXTENSION_WIKI_LINK.\n\nEXTENSION_TAGS looks like it is effectively handled by the YAML being turned on (and it is by default)\n\nbut EXTENSION_WIKI_LINK would be very useful. Since you bundle this parser in practise nobody is going to rebuild it, so the configuration choices you make will have wide effects. I can't think of any drawbacks to enabling EXTENSION_WIKI_LINK.\n\nThanks!\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTS parser has wiki link nodes in it",
