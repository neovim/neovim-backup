    "body": "### Problem\n\nIt took me a while to figure out what was happening here, but [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/lua/snacks/bigfile.lua#L38) adds a wildcard pattern to detect large files and set a `bigfile` filetype on it. \n\nI have a separate wildcard pattern in my config to assign the `clojure` filetype when a file has an appropriate shebang for babashka (eg: `#!/usr/bin/env bb`) so they don't _need_ to have a .clj extension.\n\nSince patterns are stored in `filetype.lua` in a map and then sorted based on that, and because `snacks.nvim` gets loaded *after* my personal configs, my wildcard pattern gets stepped on, and the file gets detected as type `bitbake` instead.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Install `snacks.nvim` in whatever way preferred \n- Add another `.*` filetype pattern somewhere, eg:\n\n```lua\nvim.filetype.add({\n  pattern = {\n    [\".*\"] = {\n      function(_, bufnr)\n        local content = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(bufnr, 0, 1, false)[1] or \"\"\n        if vim.startswith(content, \"#!/usr/bin/env bb\") then\n          return \"clojure\"\n        end\n      end,\n      { priority = -math.huge },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n- Notice that whichever pattern was loaded second \"wins.\" In my case, the pattern set above will not be respected and any file with the shebang being checked for will be detected as `bitbake`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSince the docs specifically recommend this approach for doing content-based matching, it'd be nice if both filetype detection patterns could work in harmony. \n\nAlternatively:\n- Add a way to add shebang-based filetype matches (eg `vim.filetype.add { shebang = { bb = 'clojure' } }` since that seems to exist in already in detect.lua—although I'm not sure at what point it's picking up `bitbake` and whether this would be able to override that detection\n- I can set my pattern to eg `..*` which is distinct from `.*`. This works to get me unblocked for now but is very much a kludge\n\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nTested on both v0.12.0-dev and v0.10.3\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, this is nvim-specific\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.4.1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niTerm2 3.5.11\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\napt/brew",

So, yes, _right now_ this is expected, and a strong argument is needed for changing this (which I haven't seen so far, but this of course doesn't mean it doesn't exist). The typical solution for such problems is to contribute such new logic to Vim (from which we'll then port it) so it can become part of the default lookup.",
