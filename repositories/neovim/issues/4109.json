This would make editing over SSH very seamless. You already have the terminal open and maybe you were doing something and bam if you type nvim you can edit now in your already open instance (access to clipboard etc).\r\n\r\nI know about netrw's ability to edit files over the network but it would be really nice if it was seamless. I have to type `e scp://server/pathtofile` which is really annoying but a simple `nvim file` would make it much easier. \r\n\r\nSecond is either syncing the working directories of the terminals with neovim similar to `set autochdir` or to be able to again pipe straight into the open neovim instance from the terminal. \r\n\r\nThese are ideas I want to implement myself but I wanted some input first.\r\n\r\nedit: nvm I'm never gonna have the time to implement all this.

There is already a communication channel open and it may be used: just use special escape sequences like `{special escape}{length}{contents}` to communicate in both directions.\n\nOne such variant is creating a special API which can basically do four things: tell local* Neovim to open file with given name (transformed into something like `termfile://{terminal buffer ID}/{received file name}`, `{received file name}` is nothing other then identifier for remote), tell remote Neovim to write file with given name, tell remote Neovim to send special file associated with the given file name contents (I mean swap and persistent undo files) and tell remote Neovim to write special file associated with the given file name contents.\n\nIt is also possible to leave only “remote write file” command, while “remote to local” communication would be “local do {usual msgpack API call}”, “remote write file” command will be issued by `BufWriteCmd` based on information provided by remote via API calls.\n\nThese variants though take over the terminal session, to make them not do this one needs a wrapper so that channel will look like `local <> :terminal <> [ssh <> ]remote <> shell` where remote will parse only special escape sequences and take over any `nvim` launches in the shell, otherwise leaving communications untouched.\n\n\\* local: Neovim which has `:terminal` open. remote: Neovim which is opened in `:terminal`.

Since I have neovim configured to listen locally on port 6666 any connections on the remote port 6666 will actually redirect to my local neovim. \n\nLastly I created this very small script for testing.\n\n``` python\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nfrom neovim import attach\nimport sys, os.path\n\nargs = sys.argv[1:]\nif not args:\n    print(\"Usage: nvimt <filename> ...\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\naddr = os.environ[\"NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS\"]\nif not addr:\n    # TODO: Open a new nvim instance if no addr\n    sys.exit(2)\n\nip, separator, port = addr.rpartition(':')\nassert separator\nport = int(port)\nnvim = attach(\"tcp\", path=ip, port=port)\n\ndef normalizePath(name):\n    path = os.path.abspath(name).replace(\" \", \"\\\\ \")\n    if os.path.isdir(name):\n        path += \"/\"\n    return path\n\ndef openFiles():\n    #TODO check if ssh\n    for x in args:\n        nvim.command(\"drop scp://ezekiel/{}\".format(normalizePath(x)))\n\nopenFiles()\n```\n\nIt only works over ssh atm though with minor modifications I could get it to change the path depending on if its running locally or remote but as it was only for testing ssh and I plan on adding this functionality to #mhinz/neovim-remote I didn't bother as its trivial.\n\n`let g:netrw_silent=1` is also very useful as it prevents the annoying press key to continue messages.\n",

Just in place of writing something to socket you write something to `stdout`, but prefix it with `{escape sequence}{legth}{separator}` (e.g. `<Esc>[Nvim:1024:{contents}`), same for answers. The only configuration you need to do here is run shell like `nvim-wrapper zsh` to make answers sent by the local Neovim to the remote be catched by the wrapper in place of confusing currently running application (also to open something with local Neovim `nvim` needs to be a script which notifies wrapper). Though if you run tmux or screen on remote wrapper additionally needs to escape everything to pass it through tmux/screen unchanged.\n",

This is literally only 1 line in ~/.zshrc and 2 lines in ~/.ssh/config and a tiny little script. Its not that complicated. As for determining the host you're right, I'm not sure. Perhaps a option on the command line. \n\nBut I guess the escape sequences are a much more clean way to handle this. If I wanted to implement the escape sequences, which files should I poke around with?\n",
