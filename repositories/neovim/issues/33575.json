Especially if we don't have any clear criteria for inclusion.\n\nHow will we deal with the off-spec extensions? E.g. clangd is arguably popular but lspconfig includes off-spec stuff. So far we have a strict \"no off-spec rule\". If we soften that up, we open another flood gate. Keeping in mind that features often trickle in slowly. Each addition looks reasonably small and before you know we have 10+ extra commands for 30 of those 40 configs.\n\nIf we don't add off-spec (which I think we really shouldn't), then you have another difference, and upstreaming the configs from lspconfig becomes more difficult - unless we remove them there too.\n\nAnd it will further add to user confusion in regards to what contains what.  (E.g. java users will then have neovim core, lspconfig, nvim-jdtls, and nvim-java and try to reason about the differences somehow. And as author of nvim-jdtls I'd have to consider config merge behavior between nvim-jdtls and only core, nvim-jdtls and core+lspconfig; Especially the `on_attach` merge behavior will be problematic (run all) )\n",

Depending on that they either still need to install lspconfig or decide to configure the missing ones manually. Or attempt to create a PR and learn that because of maintainer gut feeling their server doesn't qualify. \n\nI don't get why you want this subset restriction.

Maybe not that far away\n\nYes, I do plan to have something reviewable in single digit May. **Edit**: well, there is a significant progress, but not quite reviewable yet. Will try to work on it every day until it is in good shape for PR.\n\nAnd for what it's worth going the \"built-in plugin manager plus install specialized plugin\" seems like a more robust long term alternative. I would even go as far as to suggest introducing specialized language plugins which could contain at least both tree-sitter and LSP data, but it is a bit early for that.\n\n",

I guess my personal issue here is that bundling LSP configs still won't make it truly an \"out of the box\" experience, since users still need to install LSP servers themselves. So if enabling LSP would still require manual actions, then adding a potential one-liner to download LSP configs shouldn't be asking too much. In exchange it leaves all the usual benefits of \"plugin-vs-bundle\": enabling faster reactions after LSP server updates, allowing to delegate more when making decisions, etc.\n\nThis, for example, is different from tree-sitter parsers which do work out of the box if bundled in Nvim itself (at least on clean install).",

I don't use Python to know what the LSP state is in that space.\n\n> Go, Rust, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Bash, PHP etc should require a small amount of manual action in my opinion.\n\n\nDepending on which programming language statistics you look at (https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies, https://www.index.dev/blog/most-popular-programming-languages-, https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024) you'd also have to include html, css, sql, bash, java if you wanted to include js/typescript.\n\nAnd how will this even work long-term? Would we replace bundled configs once another language becomes more popular? Or do we end up with the 20-40 configs anyway in the next 10 years?\n\nThis all sounds a lot like \"_My_ used servers should be included, I'm okay if others require configuration\"\n\nFor tree-sitter parsers the criteria is that they're used as building blocks for other functionality within nvim. `:help` uses vimdoc, lua, c for syntax highlighting, toc and jump functionality. The query parser is used for `:EditQuery`, LSP hover uses markdown.\n\n\nWith the plugin manager addition we're talking about saving **1** additional line of config if some configs were bundled, and that's _only_ for those who use the matching subset if that matches their requirements.\n",

            "body": "Absolutely difficult to document what should be included in nvim and what should be included in nvim-lspconfig, but perhaps there is a vague consensus to consider whether nvim can bundle it. The following is just an example based on my thoughts.\n\nPriority can be given to bundling these language servers, as they are almost bundled with their corresponding toolchains:\n\n* clangd, which is included in clang-tools. On Linux distributions like archlinux where packaging granularity is not very fine, or on Windows, as long as the user has installed clang, clangd will be installed;\n* rust-analyzer, which is already regarded as an official \"component\" of Rust, can be added via rustup.\n* gopls, similar to rust-analyzer, is the official tool for Go.\n* tsserver, which is part of TypeScript, is included in any project that depends on TypeScript. Although it currently uses a private protocol, its next major version, rewritten in Go, will be an LSP.\n* lua-language-server, although it is entirely a community project, it is the standard implementation of the type annotations (LuaCATS) used by nvim.\n\nFor the above LSP servers, they are either directly included with the corresponding language toolchain or can be obtained through the toolchain commands, even on Windows. Even the out-of-the-box vscode just calls their SDKs in the background to install them, and this installation method can be shared across all editors, including neovim.\n\nSome language servers that are unrelated to the official toolchain but have good support can also be considered, though this is controversial:\n\n* html/css/json/eslint language servers, supported by vscode, the de facto official LSP implementation.\n\nLanguage popularity is a necessary condition because the point of bundling them is to benefit the majority. But this is not a sufficient condition; for example, these languages are very popular but are not recommended to be bundled directly:\n\n* pyright, which is a M$ stripped version of pylance and requires Node.js available on the system to use;\n* jdtls, although it is maintained by a large organization, has no direct connection with the Java development team itself. Moreover, even starting it is highly personalized, such as setting the available heap size or whether to use lombok. Bundling it within nvim won't contribute much to out-of-the-box usability;\n\nAnyway, I think this is not choosing 0 or 256, choosing 16 or 32 is also possible. Package managers often provide different levels of support, which is very common. Take Arch Linux as an example. It has two repositories, core and extra, both officially maintained. Similarly, it makes sense for nvim to provide \"core\" support built-in and \"extra\" support via nvim-lspconfig. Maintainers can require that every LSP configuration included in nvim must be \"promoted\" from nvim-lspconfig. If someone asks why the LSP configuration they need is not bundled, it is reasonable to ask them to start a PR from lspconfig or refuse to bundle it as it already exists in lspconfig.",

            "body": "Would agree with @mfussenegger, shipping just some configs from lspconfig is pointless. The value of lpsconfig is not only in the configurations part, but the other more complex integration that it does with the native lsp API. Handling and registering workspaceFolders and workspaces, and many more etc. \n\nI my self would like to see a rewrite of lspconfig to make it more robust, useful and self sufficient, to be the primary lsp plugin people need to install to have a working lsp enviroment, and not 10 different plugins, also to handle common pain points and make it more streamlined. To be more robust in handling workspaceFolders and workspaces for language clients, to be able to load lsp settings automatically from the project directory, to provide a good reasonable api, to define how a project directories, workspace folders and workspaces are discovered and more. It should handle things like https://github.com/tamago324/nlsp-settings.nvim - a reasonable implementation of something like this should exist in nvim lsp config. \n\nPlugins like nvim-jdtls should be considered to be upstreamed, the current configuration for jdtls in nvim-lspconfig is useless, covers less than 20% of the features one needs on a daily basis, or rewrite the nvim lspconfig in such a way that it could work with/link git sub module to link to external plugin repos which are approved by core, follow the guide lines and are maintained - like nvim-jdtls for example. Or have something like a actively maintained schema of lsp plugins which lspconfig pulls when a certain language server is configured, like what mason does, there are many options here to choose from, but sticking them into core is the worst imo. There are as mentioned below things like jdtls which are way too fluent and way too offspec to go in there, and yet a primary server for a widely used language.\n\nLspconfig or core should expose some API, that plugins like **nvim-jdtls** (not picking on it, just have the most experience with its code base) can adhere to, to register themselves because at the moment it is a wild wild west, the way certain lsp plugins work is vastly different than others, and it is a mess.\n\nJtls is the pinnacle of messy/bad language server 'spec', with its extensions and offspec implementation details, and can be used as a testing/verification ground for certain design decisions\n\n- [nvim-jdtls](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls) - is registred through its own api which is called in a filetype autocommand\n- [tstools](https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim) - uses its own .setup to configure itself, like may others\n\n**The way VSCode's extensions API works is extremely well thought out - https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api. Gives a good control over extensions and their lifetime, allows one extension to activate another, or wait for another to be activated, restart itself and also call the api of one extension from another one in a well defined way.\n\nThis should be considered imo as a general way to improve the plugin ecosystem altogether, in the long run, not just specifically targeting LSP. To give the plugins, like vscode's extension a more robust framework to adhere to, most are already doing this by design, with simple things like the .setup function, but that should be enhanced.**\n\nThis has been an issue for some language servers like sonarlint which require the primary server to be first started, and sonarlint has to then be notified that that has happened, because it has to query the primary server for information. Or if the didChangeConfiguration of the primary server changes and so on.",
