    "body": "AFAICT (documentation and brief source check), window resizing always goes \"downwards\"; if a window is expanded or shrunk, it shrinks or expands the buffer below it unless there is no downward space, and only then shrinks the buffer above.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes I have buffers above the current window that I'd rather shrink when I expand the current window.\r\n\r\nI suppose that can reasonably be scripted, though it's slightly painful due to #6643.  If there's pushback, that's a fine solution, but I don't see any major reason why there couldn't be a flag to resize upwards rather than downwards.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example consider the following sequence from a fresh `nvim -u NORC`:\r\n```\r\n:sp\r\n:sp\r\n:wincmd j\r\n:resize +3\r\n```\r\nMaybe window 3 was exactly as big as I want it, but I really only need window 1 to be a couple lines.  Currently, I have to replace `:resize +3` with either `:wincmd k | resize -3 | wincmd j` or `1 resize -3` (though as noted in #6643, that doesn't quite do what you expect), which are both uglier and are fragile if there are multiple windows above the current one.  Why not just have something like `:resize up +3`?",
