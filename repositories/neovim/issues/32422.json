inform the\n>         \" user somehow about a broken json config?\n>         return\n>     endtry\n```\n\nThe original implementation gets `compilerOptions` and `paths` from the `tsconfig.json` file and uses them, but with this approach those options will be ignored if present.\nI think that a better approach would be to read those options regardless of issues with the file format.\n\n### Does this affect Vim?\nNo, I just downloaded the AppImage for Vim v9.1.1106 and I couldn't reproduce the issue.\nhttps://github.com/vim/vim-appimage/releases/tag/v9.1.1106\n\nFrom the discussion on the original repo (https://github.com/wuelnerdotexe/vim-astro/issues/9) it seems that the json decoder on Vim is more tolerant to trailing commas than Neovim's json decoder.\n\n\n### How to proceed?\nOn another Astro related issue there's a comment saying that Neovim doesn't maintain the file, that the changes are ported from the maintainer to Vim and then to Neovim.\nSee: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/31225#issuecomment-2479017474\n\nThe problem is that this is not affecting Vim, so I imagine there won't be a fix for this that Neovim could port from Vim.\n\nMaybe the proper fix is to have a more resilient json decoder?\n\n\n### References\n- Pull request where the Astro file type support was merged on Vim: https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/14561\n- Pull request where the changes where ported to Neovim: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28442\n- The Astro file support was ported to Vim from https://github.com/wuelnerdotexe/vim-astro\n- Discussion about the json parsing problem on the original repo: https://github.com/wuelnerdotexe/vim-astro/issues/9\n- Someone experienced this issue and solved it by removing the trailing comma: https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1f9m7lb/error_when_opening_astro_files_can_someone_help/\n- Neovim version tested: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.10.4 (got `nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`)\n- Vim version tested: https://github.com/vim/vim-appimage/releases/tag/v9.1.1106 (got `Vim-v9.1.1106.glibc2.29-x86_64.AppImage`)\n- There's a closed bug report about this problem already, with the recommendation of removing the trailing comma: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/29300\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, Vim v9.1.1106\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04.5 LTS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkonsole 21.12.3\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from the repo, nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz",

I went through my configs and updated plugins to see if something broke before finding the culprit.\n\nNote that if we add two trailing commas (just trying to break it at this point), Astro files break for both Vim and Neovim.\n\nIs this discussion something that should happen on https://github.com/wuelnerdotexe/vim-astro ?

Does seem to work if it's on a separate line.\n\nIt doesn't look like that library is maintained anymore. The last commit is from 2 years ago and that PR is from over a year ago with no activity. But it looks like astro.vim was added directly to vim with the patch from that pull request around that time with a comment that it was ported from wuelnerdotexe's repo.\n\nI created an issue in the vim repo like you suggested: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/18141",
