    "body": "### Problem\n\nMostly the language id matches vim's file type, like `c` and `cpp`. But in particular cases, they may don't match and cause problems. One of these cases is C#: When using latest `master` build of [csharp-language-server](https://github.com/razzmatazz/csharp-language-server), all things like hover documentation, go to definition stopped working because nvim is using buffer's file type `cs` as id, while the server expects `csharp`.\n\nIt's worth noticing that `csharp` is the recommended language id for C# [in the LSP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentItem), so there's nothing wrong with the server.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAn obvious solution is to just change the file type to match the language id. However, file types like `cs` are already widely used in the community, and changing that might require a lot of plugins to change and also lots of incompablities.\n\nHence, I propose a new field for `vim.lsp.ClientConfig` like that:\n```lua\n{\n    ft_map = { cs = \"csharp\" }\n}\n```\n\nSo that when nvim communicates with server or checks for capabilities, it firstly tries to transform file type to language id using this table, and then falls back to file type itself if not found.\n",
