    "body": "In API design, one needs to decide whether to model data as primitives (simple types: string/number/map/list) or classes (special-purpose types: metatable-enhanced objects in Lua).\r\n\r\nSpecial-purpose types are more \"rich\" and often feel more ergonomic initially--especially to the API designer, who is most intimate with the interface. But can be cumbersome because authoring data then requires the runtime, or a translation format. Example: Vim uses a special type for its [job](https://vimhelp.org/channel.txt.html#job) objects whereas Nvim uses a primitive (number = job id).\r\n\r\n## Guidance: when to use primitives vs special types\r\n\r\nThis question is ever-present when designing APIs so we would benefit from a framework for deciding when to use primitives vs special types.\r\n\r\n### Primitives\r\n\r\n- Pros\r\n    - Primitives are more portable: copy/paste, serialization, Vimscript bridge, RPC, …\r\n    - Easy to inspect: `print(o)`, debuggers\r\n    - Easy to author and store raw data (e.g. for tests)\r\n- Cons\r\n    - No structure/shape, must be parsed/normalized.\r\n\r\n### Special types\r\n\r\n- Pros\r\n    - Ergonomics (API discovery?). Methods are on the object and/or the object is only compatible with specific functions)\r\n    - Shape enforcement / validation.\r\n        - Example: `Uri` or `Path` object is always \"normalized\" because its segments are structural. #16800\r\n- Cons\r\n    - Cumbersome outside of the prescribed interface (requires de/serialization)\r\n    - At \"edges\" the data must be normalized anyway. RPC, Vimscript <=> Lua, …, all require normalization when marshalling.\r\n        - Example: `Uri` or `Path` object will need to be normalized (deterministically de/serialized).",
