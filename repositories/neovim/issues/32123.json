Currently adding most of these is only possible either by writing your own language server or via a plugin like null.ls or now none.ls. Being able to add your own inlay hints / codelens / code_actions etc yourself using a higher level API than LSP is a notable win for lowering the entry barrier.\n\nOnce good example of this is VS Code plugin API. While adding all of those is not possible in a user config, the plugin API mostly resembles the LSP spec, yet provides a higher level abstraction which makes it possible for less experienced developers to be productive.",

It worked well enough but the biggest limitation was it \"felt\" unstable in non-file buffers and most of the time I do want snippets to work in non-file buffers. I have seen discussions in other issues  (I don't remember which one) here claiming that the LSP spec does not explicitly allow attaching to non-file buffers. I have doubts on that claim but at the time I attributed some of my instability to it. Although, personally I do think the LSP protocal does allow non-file buffers because of the the statement \"There is also a tagging interface for normal non document URIs. It maps to a string as well\" at https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#uri.\n\nIf neovim doesn't/won't support attaching LSP's to non-file buffers, then I think having a seperate API that is seperate from the LSP client for adding completion sources would be very benificial. \n\nHowever, if neovim's lsp client does support non-file buffers (and my instability was due to something else), I still think a seperate API for completion sources can be benificial since it will probably be easier for new plugin authors than trying to write an LSP. Learning to write a plugin using neovims API is always going to be easier than having to also on top of that learn both the LSP spec and how to write an LSP. Following the [vim.lsp.server PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/24338) does keep you in neovim land but you still need to understand enough of LSP spec to do so. Whether reducing that learning curve is enough to justify the added maintanence burden I'm not sure, but I think it is worth considering.",

Not fuzzy anecdotes or vague feelings.\n\n\nTo recap the current state (as of master/0.11)\n\n- We've got `vim.lsp.completion` that provides aggregated (per concat) completion candidates from multiple language servers/clients. This supports auto completion via trigger characters, plus snippet expansion and other side effects.\n- There's also lsp omnifunc (set by default if a buffer has a lsp client attached) based on `lsp.completion` for users who prefer manual triggers (`c-x c-o`)\n- A language server is a separate process (stdio), service (tcp) or a lua table with some functions (currently requires some boilerplate, `lsp.server` will reduce this)\n- Language servers can work on all kind of buffers (exception might be `prompt` buftype, which if I remember right has some issues if the server wants incremental text document synchronization, but this isn't a blocker; or necessity for the lua-in-proc variant)\n\n- Plugins could register additional completion sources via lsp.config\n\n- There are plugins using this approach (https://github.com/nvimdev/phoenix.nvim, https://github.com/benlubas/cmp2lsp)\n\n\n\nAlso, a rough outline what kind of functionality a `vim.completion` would need:\n\n- A way for plugins to register the source (overlaps with `lsp.config`)\n- A way for users to enable the source (could be plugin.setup() or `vim.completion` specific, overlaps with `lsp.enable`)\n- A way for users to setup and configure `vim.completion` (which sources to use, what kind of triggers, etc.) (overlaps with `lsp.completion.enable`)\n- An extension to `complete-items` or an alternative to be able to able to support use-cases like snippets. (Strong overlap with the language server specification for the completion results.)\n\nSo far it is clear that this subsystem would be quite big, have large overlaps with `lsp.completion` and it remains unclear what the advantages would be.\n\nNote that both of these exclude re-implementing existing completion functions like filename completion as source for these interfaces. That could be done in both scenarios.\n\n\n---\n\n**Please only comment on this thread if you have a concrete technical limitation of `lsp.completion`** or points to add to the above.\n",
