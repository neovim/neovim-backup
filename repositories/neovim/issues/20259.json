The if you add the `c` flag to the substitution command to confirm each substitution you no longer have a preview for what the substitution will be when the confirm dialog is active.\r\n\r\nI think it would be really useful if one could preview the changes before confirming a substitution, maybe either as virtual text or in the split used by `inccommand`.\r\n\r\nWould this make sense? If so, would it fit in core or better in a plugin? I'd be happy to try to work on this if it sounds like a good idea. Although I don't know in detail how to do it yet.",
