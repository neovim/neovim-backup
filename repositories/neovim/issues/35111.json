    "body": "### Problem\n\nIn the command line with `wildmenu` set, dotfiles (files starting with `.`, which are hidden by default on Unix-likes) will not be offered as completion options.\n\nIf you type `:e ~/` and press `<TAB>`, no dotfiles (e.g. `~/.config`) will be displayed in the menu. Once you type `:e ~/.`, then dotfiles will be shown. But before then, they will be silently hidden.\n\nThe `wildignore` option lets you specify _additional_ patterns to hide from completion, but Neovim behaves as if this list always contains `.*` by default.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would like to be able to complete dotfiles automatically, or at least display them at the bottom of the completion list. I find it unintuitive for them to be hidden, especially if I'm attempting to edit a file in a directory that _only_ contains dotfiles: no options are shown until I type a dot, and nothing indicates that more options will be available once I do so.\n\nPotential solutions:\n- Change the default behavior to always complete dotfiles. This is probably too disruptive to implement.\n- Add a `wildshowdotfiles` option to customize this behavior. It could either be a simple boolean, or it could also accept a string like `\"end\"` to indicate that dotfiles will be shown at the end of the list, or `\"ifempty\"` to indicate that dotfiles will only be shown if there are no non-dotfiles available for completion.\n- Add a `wildunignore` option to indicate paths to _always_ show in `wildmenu` completion, or 'allowlist' syntax like `!.*` could be added to `wildignore` to indicate that those paths should always be shown.",

For example, to opt-in to \"find all files\" without messing with 'path', I use:\n\n    :nnoremap <C-f> :edit **/\n\nMappings are a 100% valid part of the \"options\" interface of Vim. Something might not be a formal \"option\", but mappings exist to serve the infinite universe of other use-cases.\n\nThere is also a tracking issue somewhere to enhance cmdline aliases, so that you could alias lowercase `:e` and it'll do whatever you want. \n\nMeanwhile, `nvim_parse_cmd()` is very useful for intelligently parsing the cmdline, so you can create a robust mapping.\n\nAlternatively, you could request your idea at https://github.com/vim/vim and we'll merge whatever they do, probably.\n\n> Add a `wildshowdotfiles` option to customize this behavior.
