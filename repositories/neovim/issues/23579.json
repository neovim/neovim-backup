From what I know\r\n\r\n* type marshalling: Yes, the component model takes away the burden of agreeing on a representation and writing the glue code from host (neovim) and plugin developers. At least for [the component types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Explainer.md#type-definitions), WASM compiler and runtime will handle the type conversion.\r\n* Event handlers, hooks, and callback: I believe this can be \"handle types\" in the same proposal. I'll need to looking to more for it.\r\n* Streaming: The next milestone for the component model will be supporting async futures and streams. They've released a [explainer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MNVOZ8hdofO3tI0szg_i-Yoy0N2QPU2C--LzVuoGSlE/edit#slide=id.p) and seems promising.\r\n* WASI / system stuff: There are a lot of possibility here. We can expose Neovim's libuv bindings, or use Wasi/wasix directly, or do both. This will give a huge benefit for WASM plugin interface: users will be able to controll what functions the plugin can use (whether it can read/write files, etc.)",

            "body": "Hi, I complete the generator for generating all Neovim's API functions, including their [WIT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md) definition and wrapper function implementations. Most of the functions can be called from WASM module now (expect those requiring LuaRef and callbacks). Here is a [small module](https://github.com/bobogei81123/neovim/blob/wasm/wasm/example/simple_plugin/src/lib.rs) that calls `nvim_create_buf`, `nvim_open_win`, and `nvim_buf_set_lines` APIs:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-07-14 20-12-01](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/74331647/5b66ea7b-f0b3-419e-a450-4b1b006fd74f)\r\n\r\nSomething that can be done next:\r\n- Make callback works (probably need resource in the component module proposal?)\r\n- Port some simple plugin to WASM and see how well it works.\r\n- Implement Lua runtimes (LSP, etc.) natively.\r\n- Make API functions more friendly for WASM. And because WASM binds directly to the C API functions we should be able to do much more cool stuff.",
