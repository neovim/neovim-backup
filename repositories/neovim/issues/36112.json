At least they should be named similarly.\n    - `vim_FullName` => `path_fullname`\n    - `fix_fname` => `path_fix_fullname`",

The latter is a wrapper around `FullName/mch_FullName`, mainly to make it easier to reuse elsewhere (this is based on my reading of the code, I couldn't find further document).\nI also feel their logic could be simplified for Neovim, and I'm continuing to investigate this. BTW, I'm also interested in addressing path/slash issues on Windows. I've explored several issues and left some comments or PRs, such as https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7930#issuecomment-3688589896, #37084, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27401#issuecomment-3691459050, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/31606#issuecomment-3694483917, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33824#issuecomment-3694447302, and expect to make more progress over the next two months. :)",
