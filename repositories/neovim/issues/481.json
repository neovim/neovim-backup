    "body": "Currently I see documentation of functions both near their declarations and their definitions, which is inconsistent. Suggestion: require documentation _only_ near definitions. Reasoning:\n1. Given you have definitions it is easy to create declarations automatically. Reverse is not true. But automatic creation is much easier to implement if you do not need to filter out functions that already have definitions: i.e. you can just remove all declarations and recreate them, I know how to do this with a vim one-liner. Obviously this is not possible to achieve if documentation is near declarations.\n2. It is much easier to forget to update documentation if it is far away from the code you just modified, especially if you have not modified function signature.\n3. It is harder to look at code while writing documentation in case of small functions (in case of large functions you will have to view file in two windows or jump back and forward in any case).\n\nBy the way, how about doing like zsh does and not requiring any declarations at all, generating them on compile stage instead?\n",

Not being a fan of boilerplate is one of the reasons I choose to use Cmake glob feature to generate the source file list(no need to keep a source file in the directory if it's not going to be compiled, right?). I say we use the computer to automate all grunt work we can.\n\n@jszakmeister I don't like forward static declarations, but I had two reasons for deciding to use them:\n- Avoid worrying about dependency order of  static functions.\n- Mutually recursive static functions would require at least one static declaration, so it's better to be consistent and just declare all of them.\n\nI think we should move documentation to the function definitions as @ZyX-I suggested, automatically generate declarations with the documentation so doxygen will be happy and look into automatically injecting declarations of static functions at the top of C files before compilation. \n\nWe can use the lua infrastructure already setup into the project to perform this pre-CPP stage(which I was already planning to use to generate the msgpack-rpc API dispatch function, possibly fed from an yaml file containing the API description)\n",
