No\r\n- Operating system/version: Arch, running kernel 5.3.13\r\n- Terminal name/version: Konsole 19.08.3\r\n- `$TERM`: xterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen I edit a file, and it's been bind-mounted with Docker, I expect to see the changes inside the container. However, the file inside the container does not reflect that change.\r\n\r\nI believe it's because of https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15793, quoted below:\r\n\r\n> If you are using some editor like vim, when you save the file it does not save the file directly, rather it creates a new file and copies it into place.\r\nThis breaks the bind-mount, which is based on inode. Since saving the file effectively changes the inode, changes will not propagate into the container.\r\nWhen the container is restarted the new inode.\r\nIf you edit the file in place you should see changes propagate.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nNeovim doesn't create a brand-new file when saving, but instead reuses the existing file.\r\n\r\nI would like this behaviour to change, either with some combination of settings or always. I think it would be less surprising if the default were to change as well.",
