    "body": "### Problem\n\n\"Zen mode\" plugins such as [zen-mode.nvim](https://github.com/folke/zen-mode.nvim) or [no-neck-pain.nvim](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim) emulate padding on a window by creating a float or splits. With the float solution, splits cannot be used (e.g. nvim-tree). With the splits solution, the splits disrupt window navigation as those splits really are there as \"empty space\", but still the user can navigate to them.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAdd a way (perhaps a window local option) to add padding to a window. The use case I'm thiking of is zen mode, so the idea is that the window contents are centered, so either a single padding value or individual left/right would work. Implementing this would close the issue for me. Bonus: Add a new highlight group to style the padded area.\n\nI've made mockups (just image editing, no implementation at all) about how using this for a zen mode plugin may look:\n\n| No tabline, no new hl | No tabline, new hl | Tabline, new hl | Tabline, new hl, nvim-tree |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab72d79f-280a-45f1-b08a-dbc65ed7fc43)|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a69acb29-58c5-4ee7-aa99-6c5c4ce1e8b9)|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46361f33-3c20-49d6-94dd-3c25da0fa14d)|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4065ece3-4cbd-4788-a8a5-6020c8d1a77f)|\n\nGeneralization: To extend this for other use cases, perhaps the padding option should allow also top/bottom, e.g. to control padding on floats, and the new highlight group should instead be 2 different highlight groups: one for regular windows and another for floats.",
