I'm not there yet but as I understand it a window is just a place where a buffer is shown. So if the buffer is closed/deleted the window should remain open, just as it does if I have no splits (window remains open, at least it looks like that... ).\r\n\r\nSo looking at the behavior with no splits compared to behavior with splits it is not consistent.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is not intuitive too and in contrast to some other vim stuff that is not intuitive but still makes sense as you grasp the idea behind it.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, I try to embrace the vim style of doing things all the time. So if you can tell me what the vim way of \"keep the window and just close the damn buffer\" is I would appreciate that. Otherwise there should at least be a single command that does the right thing and in best case the bd command does what the name suggests and another one is added that mimics the old behavior if someone needs it.\r\n\r\nIll donate 10$ for the option to have correct behavior and 30 if the bd command is changed to do what the name suggest :)\r\n\r\nPS: I use the following as a workaround, which actually works good enough for me, although I am only using it for few minutes.\r\n\" use ctrl+x to close buffer\r\nnnoremap <C-x> :bnext<CR>:bd#<CR>",

If this breaks users favourite plugins, the user can set the option back to the default value, or/and make a new issue to the plugin development forum, which can have the effect that the new option is taken into an account in the next version of the plugin, after which the user can again set the non-default value for the option.\r\n\r\nI also like the idea of `ZB`, but to me it only makes sense if it has a corresponding Ex command, like `ZZ` and `ZQ` do.
