On (interactive) startup, asynchronously (CursorHold?), store the contents of `news.txt` at `stdpath('state')`\r\n    - also store the current Nvim version in a shada-stored variable like `g:NVIM_VERSION`\r\n2. On (interactive) startup, compare the current Nvim version to `g:NVIM_VERSION`.\r\n    - related: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20981\r\n3. If current version is newer, store it in `g:NVIM_VERSION`.\r\n4. If `g:NVIM_VERSION` was defined (and older than current version, _or if the versions are equal but the contents of `news.txt` are bigger_),\r\n    - Diff the old news.txt with the current news.txt.
