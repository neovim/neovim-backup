Those are the only people who need to consent, since all new code is already Apache licensed, from what it sounds like. But even if the new post-fork code also needs to relicense, [there are only 14 contributors post-fork](https://github.com/neovim/unibilium/graphs/contributors).\n\nFor context: in a different project I contributed to years ago, [they chose to relicense](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1570) and just replying to a Github issue with a templated affirmation was considered sufficient. That had hundreds of contributors and still succeeded in relicensing. Should be possible here with the much smaller number of contributors, and easier than replacing a core dependency.\n\nAlthough it sounds like [there is a plan to move to a different toolkit (?)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/21832#discussion_r1071143289), asking permission to relicense is still probably a faster way forward for the time being until that happens.",

            "body": "> Why would I want to relicense unibilium?\n\nThe [most active fork of Unibilium](https://github.com/mauke/unibilium/forks) is the one maintained by the Neovim community. No other fork (including the original Unibilium repo) has seen any activity in the last two year. This indicates that the Neovim has a vested interested in continuing development of the codebase.\n\nRe-licensing will allow active development to continue in the Neovim community. However, maintaining the current licensing will likely cause Unibilium to be dropped from Neovim at a future date, because it decreases adoption of Neovim in corporate environments. Regardless of whether those corporations are right or wrong in their hesitance to allow GPLv3/LGPLv3 licensed code, the reality is that it causes issues for end users who want to use Neovim at their job, but cannot due to a licensing conflict.\n\nAs the OP says:\n\n> Replacing unibilium will increase adoption of neovim tremendously.\n\nIf re-licensing Unibilium is a viable option, there are benefits to all parties:\n\n1. Unibilium continues to receive bug fixes and updates via the Neovim community.\n2. Unibilium sees increased adoption via being included in Neovim.\n3. Neovim community avoids doing the work required to replace a core dependency.\n4. Neovim sees increased adoption via licensing that can be used in more places.\n\nAs I see it, the potential paths forward for Neovim are the following (ordered by level of difficulty from least to most difficult):\n\n1. Receive consent to re-license Unibilium.\n2. Re-write/refactor Neovim to use a different library than Unibilium.\n3. Convince every corporate lawyer at every major tech company that GPLv3/LGPLv3 licensing is actually OK and they should have nothing to worry about.\n\nThe last one is obviously a little bit tongue-in-cheek; if you have ever worked directly with corporate lawyers it is even funnier. For as much of a win as number 3 would be, it isn't feasible in a timeline that can be easily estimated, whereas the first two are.\n\nThat is why I brought up the possibility of re-licensing: it is the simplest and fastest way to resolve this issue for Neovim, and there are benefits to Unibilium like continuing development and adoption.\n\n@mauke If you don't want to re-license after reading the rationale I've given, that is OK too, but at least the question has been asked and the option explored.",
