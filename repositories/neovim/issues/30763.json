There is nothing wrong with just accepting a string and interpret it the same way as a blob, just that you don't have have any NUL:s then. so pass in a BLOBBY BLOB whenever you actually have NUL:s. There is no ambiguity how a string will be interpreted in 'b' mode.\n\nJust deleting this unhelpful error will make the function fully compatible with lua conversion (which picks BLOB if there is NUL:s, string otherwise).
