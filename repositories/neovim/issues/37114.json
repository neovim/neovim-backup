It requires Shift-Enter, or pasting multiline text (where the old behavior was broken in its own way...).\n\n> vim's function `init_prompt` checks is current line contains prompt signature\n\nThat is fragile, and breaks if something overwrites the prompt somehow (which I have seen). \n\nTo adapt to Neovim's prompt buffer, plugins just need to use `nvim_buf_get_mark(0, ':')` ? Is there some other difficulty? \n\n~~(I just noticed `line(':')` and `getpos(':')` don't work, that seems like a bug...)~~",

The init_prompt logic tried to detect when the prompt was in an unexpected state and would “reset” by creating a new prompt at the bottom, ignoring any user-inserted text. Because of this, inserting text before or after the prompt line behaved the same way. This was never documented and was more of a quirk than an intended feature.\n\nAfter adding multiline input support to the prompt buffer, everything from the prompt line downward is now treated as user input.\nBefore when we see 2 or more lines as use input we could just call this is invalid state. But with multiline prompts that's no longer true. Because of this, we can no longer assume that appending text at the end of the buffer means a new prompt should be created. \n\nAs a result, the prompt line is now a strict boundary. Plugins that react to or display output for a prompt should insert their content above the prompt line, which is how the documentation has always recommended doing it.\n\nWith multiline input, plugins also can’t assume the last line is the prompt line anymore. To solve this, the `:` mark was added to explicitly track the prompt location. In Neovim, the recommended approach now is to use the `:` mark to find the prompt line and insert display text above it.",
