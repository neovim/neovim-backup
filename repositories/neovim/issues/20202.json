And plugin authors just to call the function to generate border option when they add `nvim_open_win()` in their plugin.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nAny ideas how to improve this suggestion? What do you think overall about this feature request?\r\n\r\n---\r\n**EDIT** as **bfredl** suggested just some lua option like `vim.ui.border_style` seems even less work to implement this and for users and plugin authors to use.",
