I don't think that's idiomatic.  Neovim, on the other hand, OS-agnostically checks if the `fname` arg of `fnamemodify()` is an absolute path and while doing so neovim expects a slash after colon.  I suggest we keep it this way.\r\n\r\n/Update/:  CMD and PowerShell accepts paths like `D:SubDir`.  That's not unexpected.  But it's relevant info to dispute my suggestion of not adopting this approach.\r\n\r\n/Update/:  Adopting `_wfullpath()` will fix #7930, too.  I am, um, reverting my suggestion.

To recap: in Windows there's apparently a difference between `C:` and `C:/`. `C:` refers to the last active directory on the drive C, while `C:/` refers to root location of drive C. So if I'm currently in directory `C:/Users/dundar`, then `cd C:` will cd to `C:/Users/dundar` while `cd C:/` will cd to `C:/`. Based on this, then `fnamemodify(\"D:SubDir\", \":p\")` should resolve to `D:<current_directory>/SubDir`. I believe this bug report is legitimate and that we should fix it.",
