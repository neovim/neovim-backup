One of the main design goals was to unify the highlight group names across the different languages, so colorschemes no longer have to define hundreds of different(ly named) groups. So adding new _types_ of labels is not something we want to consider. \n\nAnd, again, you can customize this to your heart's desire by putting your own queries in your config (either extending or replacing the current ones), so changing the default requires this to be a general improvement (which I'm not yet fully sold on in this case).",

This needs input from others.\n\n> Your issue description stated that these are not highlighted, so that is what I commented on there.\n\nIn that sense, the description was incorrect. I will correct it. What I am concerned about is \"having the same highlight.\"\n\n> Yes, but \"better\" is in the eye of the beholder. One of the main design goals was to unify the highlight group names across the different languages, so colorschemes no longer have to define hundreds of different(ly named) groups. So adding new types of labels is not something we want to consider.\n\nI understand that you wanted to simplify syntax highlighting. It is the advantages of treesitter. However, the current vimdoc also defines parent-child relationships for highlights, such as `markup.raw.block`. I believe it is possible to define these.\n\nExample: `markup.link.text`, `markup.link.tag`\n\n> And, again, you can customize this to your heart's desire by putting your own queries in your config (either extending or replacing the current ones), so changing the default requires this to be a general improvement (which I'm not yet fully sold on in this case).\n\nOf course, I understand that. If my proposal is rejected, I will customize the queries myself. However, it is best if the default syntax highlighting is improved because everyone can benefit from it.",
