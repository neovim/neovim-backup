I've had the chance to play around with TermDebug earlier today, and it's essentially just a `:terminal` that runs gdb along with a command to open a buffer and highlight the current line on `:Next`. There's a lot more work that we could get for free from Vimspector in terms of UI and interface.\n\nThe main problem I see with Vimspector is that its core is in Python, not Lua.",

He's doing a great job adding support for it, but some of the features he'd need aren't stable yet.\n\n@bfredl To your point, we should focus on first rearchitecting its interface to use as much as possible from `vim/lsp/until.lua`. Then, we can focus on porting the core; it can be a line-by-line, function-by-function, port, as long as it supports the same protocol and eventually holds up to a more rigorous testing strategy.\n\n@justinmk Does this sound agreeable to you?",

I wouldn't want a Python dependency if I was coding in, say, Java or Go.\n\n@bfredl I'll definitely see this through up to designing a roadmap of tasks on a PR that'll get the interface to where I'd want it (i.e. using `util.lua` and generalizing the same to a \"foreign protocol interface\" of something like that).\n\nBeyond that, I unfortunately don't know how much time I'll have, especially if this project goes as big as the LSP project (we'd need more contributors in that case). If I end up realizing that this is more work than I myself can handle, I'll do my best to make it easier for other like-minded contributors to take over the PR. ",
