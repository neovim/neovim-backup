However, an autocmd listening on `OptionSet foldenable` is not being triggered when this happens.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. `nvim --clean`\r\n2. `:au OptionSet foldenable echo \"foldenable: \" .. &foldenable`\r\n3. Hit `zi` multiple times. Nothing is being printed. You can `set fen?` to see that every `zi` toggles its state.\r\n4. Do `:set fen!`. The autocmd will trigger and print a message.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect the autocmd to fire when pressing `zi`.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, `:nnoremap <silent> zi :set fen!<CR>` seems to work, but I'd say this is a bug nevertheless.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.4 via AppImage, but 0.7.2 via the Debian 12 package behaves the same\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, 9.0.1499\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian 12\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.26.5\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nDebian package & AppImage",

            "body": "Actually, apparently quite a few other normal mode keystrokes that can silently change the value of `foldenable`, for example `zM` in a buffer with `nofoldenable` will toggle it to `foldenable`, but doesn't trigger `OptionSet` either.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be part of a bigger problem, namely that a _lot_ of places in the C source simply flick options by setting a new value in some C struct and `OptionSet` is never triggered for it. The issue is not limited to folding at all.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether this can be solved at all (with reasonable effort), or if the documentation for `OptionSet` should simply mention that it only reliably fires for `:set` (and maybe script constructs like `let &opt = …`, didn't test that).",
