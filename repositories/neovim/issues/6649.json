And more importantly, the installer is going to remove the registry entries and whatever integration was set up, when neovim is uninstalled. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you do `:Install` on a portable installation and delete the installation, you're left with a non-functioning hole in your windows context menu. You're going to need to either remove the registry entries per hand or we must provide a `:Uninstall` command, which the user is going to forget every single time.\r\n\r\nSo what is your opinion? \r\n",
