    "body": "### Problem\n\nI've grown used to using `\\v` in my search patterns. The problem is of course, that I'm either forced to awkwardly type them out each time or deal with unwieldy mappings.\n\nFor example mapping `:s` to `:s/\\v` is great until you want to run some other command starting with `s` (like `:source`) or when you want to use the `s//replacement` shortcut.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI propose a `'verymagic'` option similar to `'magic'`.\n\nThe obvious issue is of course conflict with existing plugins and runtime scripts. That can either be left for the user to deal with via autocommands (`CmdlineEnter, CmdlineLeave`) or the option could automatically only apply for searches invoked interactively.\n\nPersonally I would prefer the latter option, as it's hard to imagine a legitimate usecase for an option which breaks virtually all existing plugins if applied in non-interactive contexts.\n\nThe benefit could potentially be quite large, especially for new-ish users unaware of `\\v`. Default regexes are quite unwieldy as they require a lot of escaping. In time I would welcome this as an on-by-default option even.\n\nThe handling of \"interactive only\" would probably be quite tricky though, especially considering user commands defined in plugins and such.",

Super confusing for users and plugin authors.\n\nI'm surprised 'magic' isn't deprecated, we should have done that long ago. Introducing 'verymagic' makes even less sense.\n\n\n\n> For example mapping `:s` to `:s/\\v` is great until you want to run some other command starting with `s` (like `:source`) or when you want to use the `s//replacement` shortcut.\n\nWe need to think about a general approach for this, not another random flag. One idea is to introduce a new kind of abbreviation (there are currently three \"kinds\" described at `:help abbreviation`), which only activates if it is the *command* part of an *interactive* cmdline input. That solves this problem and others.\n\nMeanwhile, you can get pretty close to the ideal via `nvim_parse_cmd`, which allows a `CmdlineChanged` event-handler to correctly replace the relevant part of cmdline input.",

Yes, I could use that to rewrite my own commands by looking for commands like /, ?, :s[ubstitute], :g[lobal], :filt[er], :helpg[rep], :fu[nction], and :vim[grep]. I think that's an exhaustive list of things that match on {pattern} - that's a lot of commands to rewrite. Abbreviations also wouldn't cover things like \":fu /\" without broadening them quite a bit.\n\nBut if I want to *also* change the behavior of patterns including those passed to plugin commands, that's another step up in complexity. I want all my patterns to use good syntax without having to put extra effort into each place they're used or think about what route it's going to take.\n\nIdeally, I think very-magic mode would be the default. The only modes that make sense to me are very-no-magic and very-magic. The in-between options are just adding extra typing and thinking - do I need a backslash for this regex operator? What about this one? [neo]vim even has a couple extra weird ones like ~, which I've never seen used like that in any other text processing language.",
