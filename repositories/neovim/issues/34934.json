First it showed up after upgrade plugins w/ lazy (specifically any regarding lsp/completion), having upgraded nvim via brew (even did a full uninstall, prune & install to be sure), afterwards I decided to do both build from source, and download the binary via curl. I decided to see whether the error would surface w/o upgrading the plugins, and thats when I took the screenshot. The screenshot below is after executing hover() on a word w/in my zshrc (I understand it doesnt mean much, I just want to be as thorough as possible).\n\nWhat was strange is the fact I couldnt update certain plugins (off the top of my head: blink, barbecue, conform, and dial) \n\n<img width=\"2666\" height=\"114\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/862cb300-b180-4967-8ad6-dff0d7c74272\" />\n\n<img width=\"1168\" height=\"1353\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7639e7e2-1c59-4420-8ac6-6521ed108533\" />\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim\nLazy update\n\nor\nnvim\nopen any file\n\"K\" to open hover window.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNot this?\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-821+g12276832ab-Homebrew; Build type: Release; LuaJIT 2.1.1748459687\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.5\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.42.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew, but also binary and build from repo",
