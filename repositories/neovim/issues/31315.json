    "body": "### Problem\n\nMany of the traditional Vim syntax highlighting rules end up with patterns matching string delimiters (that is, usually quotation marks).  For instance, Ruby and Rust provide these patterns.\n\nSeveral colour schemes, including the well-known ir_black and a custom one based off of it that I use, highlight string delimiters differently than the string itself.  For instance, I use a slightly darker shade of green for the delimiters, which helps de-emphasize the delimiters.\n\nThe new treesitter rules don't appear to have that distinction, so it's not possible in the general case to colour the delimiters differently anymore.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd like the ability to do that in the future, though, since I think the treesitter rules are likely to be more useful in future releases.  My recommendation is that, by default, they're coloured as String, and then they can be overridden in a particular scheme if desired.\n\nThis will bring feature parity with the older Vim-style rules for many languages and will improve highlighting for other languages where this is not currently possible.",
