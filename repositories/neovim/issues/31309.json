Some option for scrolling would be especially helpful for previewing `:%s/<regex>` matches.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTake:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a40bce05-4dda-46f4-a93b-83bddadc1275)\n\nAny option to scroll the screen and/or jump to the next match without stopping writing the ex command would be much appreciated. :)",
