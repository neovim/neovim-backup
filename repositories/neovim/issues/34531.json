    "body": "### Problem\n\nSome Language Servers (see [the apex config for the Salesforce Apex LS](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/configs/apex_ls.lua)) do not expose a `cmd` that can be called statically, but rather require the `cmd` to be dynamically built depending on some user set parameters, such as:\n\n- The location of a given file (e.g.: the apex `jar` file)\n- Flag values for flags that must be set, but their value could be user controlled\n\nWhen moving to the new `vim.lsp.config`, we lost the capacity to dynamically build the `cmd` with user set config parameters. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI think we could add an optional `cfg` table parameter to the `vim.lsp.ClientConfig.cmd` function where those parameters could be passed in by the user, thus allowing `cmd` to be dynamically constructed (e.g.: by [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) or [mason-lspconfig](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-lspconfig.nvim#available-lsp-servers)). This would surface options to users using these while not requiring them to know the full extent of how the LS command needs to be written.\n\nBeing an optional parameter, it should not impact it not being present on existing configs, so I think this should be a rather safe and low cost addition. I'd be happy to help add it, I'd just need some guidance on where to look for possibilities of tests failing, or any extra validations that would be required by adding this.",
