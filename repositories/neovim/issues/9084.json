    "body": "When opening large files with a `set foldmethod=syntax` autocommand, neovim delays on startup while it calculates the folds to be collapsed (profiling does not reveal any script causing the delay), which is unfortunate but understandable.\r\n\r\nI normally don't like folding, i.e. I want my code to default being unfolded, but I do want the option of folding a function every once in a while. `zc` without a `foldmethod` set obviously causes an error, but I'm almost always dealing with structured code and have a relevant (or semi-relevant) vim language plugin enabled that sets up the folds correctly with `set foldmethod=syntax`.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that an autocommand in my init.vim that called `set nofoldenable foldmethod=syntax` would set the fold method without blocking to calculate and then fold all contents of the file, but `set foldmethod` appears to explicitly set `foldenable` and then proceeds to fold all contents.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't want to do is call `set foldmethod=syntax nofoldenable` which basically blocks to calculate the folds only to leave them unfolded (at least it doesn't flash the content as it folds-then-unfolds).\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of right now is to map the first `zc` in a buffer to `set foldmethod=syntax nofoldenable <CR> zc` and take the hit on first use rather than slowing each and every file load.",
