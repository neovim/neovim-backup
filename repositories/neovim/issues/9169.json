Not impossible too: all you actually need is all functions having functional reference counter, frame holding a reference *and* various async callbacks holding a reference too instead of addressing function by name. If I am not mistaking error is there precisely for those callbacks, and was not added by me.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly (Neo)Vim has a system for keeping otherwise unneeded frame structures if variables inside are referenced and dealing with them in M&S GC when time comes. And somehow copes without also having to keep function references which you in any case *cannot* possibly access from VimL if all you have is the reference to `a:`.",
