    "body": "### Problem\n\nRunning Neovim with custom XDG directories or environment variables often requires a wrapper script (e.g. `.bat`, shell script).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCommon use cases include:\n- Portable Neovim distributions\n- Multiple isolated Neovim instances\n- Sandboxed or self-contained setups\n\nToday, this typically requires a launcher script that sets environment variables (such as `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, etc.) before invoking `nvim`. While functional, this adds friction:\n- Extra scripts must be created and maintained\n- Users cannot simply run `nvim` directly\n- The setup is less discoverable and less portable\n\nProposed solution\nAllow Neovim to optionally load environment variables from a simple environment configuration file **before initialization**, if such a file exists.\n\nExample file names (name/extension not critical):\n- `nvim.env`\n- `environment.config`\n- `.nvim-env`\n\nThe file could be located in:\n- The same directory as `nvim.exe`\n- Or another clearly defined startup location\n\nThe file would contain key=value pairs, for example:\nXDG_CONFIG_HOME=./config\nXDG_DATA_HOME=./data\nXDG_STATE_HOME=./state\nXDG_CACHE_HOME=./cache\n\n\n\nThese variables would apply only to the Neovim process and would be evaluated before any configuration or runtime files are loaded.\n\nPersistence behavior:\nIf the environment configuration file does **not** exist:\n- Neovim could automatically create it on first startup\n- Populate it with sensible default paths (current behavior or portable defaults)\n- Then load and use it immediately\n\nThis would make the configuration:\n- Persistent\n- Explicit\n- Easy to modify without wrapper scripts\n\nBenefits\n- Removes the need for wrapper scripts for common setups\n- Improves portability, especially on Windows\n- Makes multi-instance and sandboxed setups easier and more discoverable\n- Provides a single, modular mechanism usable by all users\n- Fully opt-in and non-breaking for existing workflows\n\n\nMany tools support `.env`-style files to configure runtime behavior without external scripts. This proposal applies the same idea narrowly to Neovim’s startup environment.\n\nNotes\nI am happy to help test, refine the scope, or explore a plugin/prototype approach if preferred.\n",

Reinventing \"dotenv\" tools to support fully arbitrary ways of setting every env var, doesn't sound too appealing. It's a lot more scope, and introduces a Neovim-specific mechanism where general tools already exist.",
