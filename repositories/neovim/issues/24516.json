I read `:h 'winhighlight'` and it says that all of built-in hl groups can be overridden. `Cursor` and `ModeMsg` are included in `:h highlight-groups` (which is referenced in `:h 'winhighlight'`), so I assume it _should_ work, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nI firstly thought that maybe there're some UI plugins that affect that 'winhighlight' option, but as you can see below even starting neovim with the `clean` argument doesn't solve that problem.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I saw #18399 which is similar, but I don't know whether it's related to this issue.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWorking `CursorLine` example:\r\n1. nvim --clean\r\n2. `:lua vim.opt.termguicolors = true`\r\n3. `:lua vim.opt.cursorline = true`\r\n4. `:highlight MyLine guibg=#ff00ff`\r\n5. `:lua vim.api.nvim_win_set_option(0, 'winhighlight', 'CursorLine:MyLine')`\r\n6. You'll see awfully colored cursor line 🤣\r\n\r\n**Not** working `Cursor` example:\r\n\r\n1-4 steps are the same\r\n5. `:lua vim.api.nvim_win_set_option(0, 'winhighlight', 'Cursor:MyLine')`\r\n6. Nothing happens\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect `Cursor`, `ModeMsg` highlight groups to be overridden by my custom hl groups.\r\nI hope that I explained everything correctly.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI'm not sure Vim has 'winhighlight' option\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nMacOS 14.0\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWezTerm 20230408-112425-69ae8472\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew",
