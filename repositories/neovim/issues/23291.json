But of course we should make that upper bound as high as we can.\r\n\r\nFor context, the polling mechanism is used for Linux because inotify doesn't watch recursively, and libuv doesn't set up the inotify handles in a way that makes it practical (that I've found) to structure those recursively ourselves. Node.js `fs.watch` also uses libuv polling on Linux for recursive watches. I think the ideal scenario here would involve leveraging a yet-to-exist kernel-level recursive file watcher for Linux like libuv does already for macOS and Windows.\r\n\r\n@lucy You're right that filtering these files out would probably help. Right now all of that filtering is done in the LSP client after the poller is already set up, but some of that could be done earlier and lighten the load on libuv. For your example with a huge directory of files not watched by the LSP it would probably make a decent difference. I'll try that to see.\r\n\r\ncc @mfussenegger ",

From my testing it looks like there are a lot of folders watched that wouldn't need to be. See https://github.com/search?q=watcherExclude&type=code\r\n\r\n- The `parse` function that converts a glob pattern to a lpeg pattern could probably get moved to some other location. It uses standard glob syntax, nothing specific to LSP:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe glob pattern to watch relative to the base path. Glob patterns can have the following syntax:\r\n- `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment\r\n- `?` to match on one character in a path segment\r\n- `**` to match any number of path segments, including none\r\n- `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files)\r\n- `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)\r\n- `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`, but not `example.0`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it fits into `vim.fs`, or a `vim.glob`?\r\n",

Note that some LSP (such as haskell-language-server) do have a fallsback mecanism (slow in the case of HLS) when the `didChangeWatchedFiles` is not enabled. So my implementation can be useful when:\r\n\r\n- Having `didChangeWatchedFiles` disabled is painfully slow\r\n- Turning it on kills neovim\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks is that if a file change by an external process (e.g. `git checkout`), the editor will be completely lost. I'm now used to this (I was used to patch HLS in order to make it think that `didChangeWatchedFiles` was supported by neovim, see https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/3458#issuecomment-1400903415",

So far the ones mentioned here worked fine for me - no noticable difference between fs-watching on/off\r\n\r\nI didn't look into it much. It was so awful that I didn't think it was worth spending much time debugging it in when I knew the `fswatch` handler I was using was worked very well.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to chase this unicorn then I can try and create a test project, but it's pretty obvious to me that this is a non-trivial problem to solve and LibUV have said themselves they don't intend to solve this.

This just seems like a fundamental constraint with Linux. I've even taken a look at how vscode handles it, and they have similar issues, but also have a fully financed team who've been able to implement a more bespoke implementation that makes heavy use of excluding directories and is more graceful when errors occur.\n\nWe could enable it by default, but then disable it as soon as it hits some threshold?

I think this is probably worth doing. As we've found, file watching is non-trivial so longer term we shouldn't keep this on the main thread.",

After the final print and typing `:qa<cr>`, it takes ~45 seconds for Nvim to finally close. My guess is half of that time is Nvim waiting to process the keypresses, and the other half is what it takes to close out the watchers.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's the problem only on MacOS where a different watcher mechanism is used? I don't know watcher code enough, but the only place I see with uvflags is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/2f4792943aa92223fadd472f20449cd13707ff7a/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/_watchfiles.lua#L140-L143\r\n\r\nCan it be that when you are using `M._watchfunc = watch.watchdirs` on MacOS you essentially is setting up recursive watchers of recursive watchers? It can cause troubles if setting up watcher in a child directory is triggering some event on parent. Can it be that your 30 second freeze is caused by that?\r\n\r\nMy stat for nixpkgs repository after drop_caches:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWalking+filtering took: 2594.646696ms. num_files=69195\r\nHandles Took: 124.555428ms. num_dirs=28269\r\n```\r\n`inotify-stat` shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       Pid Uid        App                    Watches  Instances\r\n   3652386 1000       nvim                    28,272          1\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill anything blocking for more than 100 ms is not good, so something still has to be done for it to not block for seconds.\r\n\r\nAlso stat for entire nix store:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWalking+filtering took: 123761.444584ms. num_files=3409472                                                   \r\nHandles Took: 4646.437448ms. num_dirs=607223\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat indeed was long. nvim is using 1 GB RAM after that.",

(I think currently using two clients would end up having each client register their own watchers)\r\n> \r\n>     * Deal with watcher limits (`proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches`)\r\n> \r\n>     * Configuration for excludes? From my testing it looks like there are a lot of folders watched that wouldn't need to be. See https://github.com/search?q=watcherExclude&type=code\r\n\r\nAnother optimization can be for static file paths (no special symbols in pattern). For example nil_ls wants to watch only two files, but neovim is scanning the entire nixpkgs repository (1-2 seconds on my PC), in the end only one watch is set.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n    capabilities = {\r\n      [\"workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles\"] = { {\r\n          id = \"workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles\",\r\n          method = \"workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles\",\r\n          registerOptions = {\r\n            watchers = { {\r\n                globPattern = \"/nix/store/zyzhqfys86byv201frlpiyipzzw38p02-source/flake.lock\"\r\n              }, {\r\n                globPattern = \"/nix/store/zyzhqfys86byv201frlpiyipzzw38p02-source/flake.nix\"\r\n              } }\r\n          }\r\n        } }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso maybe some patterns, like `**` and `**/filename`, can be treated specially, like checking only for excludes during directory walking (need to setup watches on all directories, except excluded like .git). De-duplication is needed for single language server too. For example pyright wants to watch `**/pyrightconfig.json` and `**`. It results in double directory walking.",
