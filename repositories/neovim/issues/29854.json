    "body": "### Problem\n\nUsage of icons in modern terminal emulators seems to have come to a point of relatively widespread support. In particular, icons are mostly used for two purposes:\r\n- Indicate type of file in a way that is easier to skim.\r\n- Make more concise display of LSP items kind.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently there is no built-in support in Neovim. For example, there is no built-in way for users/plugins to get an icon for display purposes without installing special plugin icon provider.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe purpose of this issue is mostly to be a discussion about acceptable approaches of adding more built-in support for icons.\r\n\r\nMy current ideas/suggestions:\r\n- Add 'buficon' (as 'icon' is already taken) buffer-local option which can be a source of truth for icon best representing a buffer. It then can be treated the same way as similarly purposed \"source of truth\" buffer-local options (like, for example, 'commentstring').\r\n- Export Lua function which can return an icon string based on an input data. Similarly to `vim.filetype.match()`.\r\n\r\nThe lowest friction design seems to be to tie icon to a filetype. This would require to maintain a single table mapping filetype to icon. Similarly to [how it is currently done in 'mini.icons'](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/657ef75b52a548090fb7906735517b7ddbf39e88/lua/mini/icons.lua#L861) (but glyph only). Then implementation can roughly be like:\r\n- `vim.filetype.get_icon = function(data) return icons[data.filetype] end`\r\n- Create an autocommand for `FileType` event that sets 'buficon' based on the output of `vim.filetype.get_icon()`.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nPotential problems with overall idea of adding better built-in support for icons:\r\n- Actually deciding on requirements for potential code points. One approach is to prefer a single Nerd Fonts class and stick with it. Currently `nf-md-*` seems to have the widest range of available icon glyphs.\r\n- Dealing with potential changes in code points. I don't have a solid solution here except suggesting to treat this the same way how LSP protocol updates are currently treated.\r\n- Actually maintaining a table with \"filetype -> icon\" map. I can provide the initial table. Adding new entries can be as easy as \"Check if there is an icon *exactly* for the filetype; if no - use easily computed fallback\".",

However, the problems you listed are the exact problems I thought of and are non-trivial. Since icons _require_ a patched font, I'm also concerned about the possibility that we will receive more low-effort issues of the \"help icons aren't working\" variety, simply because the user hasn't set up their font properly. (We have a similar situation with terminal features, some of which also work only with specific terminals, and we get many issues of this nature already).\r\n\r\nI suppose as the author of mini.icons you're better equipped than I am to estimate what that issue load might look like.\r\n\r\n> Actually maintaining a table with \"filetype -> icon\" map\r\n\r\nMaintaining large databases is rote, tedious work, especially for filetypes (we already do this for filetype matching of course). Though if we clearly advertise it as \"best effort\"/\"community supported\", we can probably get away with a lower maintenance burden (although in that case, one might ask why it's included in core in the first place). The filetype runtime files fit into this category, but we piggy back on Vim's effort to maintain these so we don't adopt that maintenance burden ourselves (outside of porting updates).\r\n\r\n>Add 'buficon' (as 'icon' is already taken) buffer-local option which can be a source of truth for icon best representing a buffer.

Icons are displayed as any regular string. User potentially not having the support for displaying *some* characters doesn't stop Neovim from having their support.
