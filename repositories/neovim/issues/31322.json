In other words, the first sign shows up on the far left, with additional signs added to the right of that, up to the maximum allowed.\n\nHowever, when the signcolumn is wide, this can lead to significant visual separation between the sign and the line numbers/text when there aren't many signs on a line. For example, considering the lonely `W` at the top left, notice the big space between it and the line number:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed2c00fe-f67d-42f9-a340-3447489f9d41)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be nice if this could be configured. For example, `signalign = \"left\" | \"right\"`, where `\"left\"` equals the current default behavior (left-alignment, new signs added to the right) and `\"right\"` would beget right-alignment with new signs added to the left.",

This means there would be one on the left and one on the right.\n\nThat is not my proposal at all.\n\nMy proposal is simply to allow the order of signs in the (left) signcolumn to be flipped.
