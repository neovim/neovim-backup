I'm thinking minimized version as a QoL feature.\n\nNeovim recently included features like snippets and commenting. Both were done by third-party plugins before.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd like to see a version that is closely tied to the core like [zed](https://zed.dev)'s [multibuffers](https://zed.dev/docs/multibuffers) rather than being a separate feature, but porting `fzf.vim` to builtin plugin can be enough.",
