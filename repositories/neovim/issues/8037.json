Qt Creator has its own number/sign/fold column and its size is not to be the same as Neovim's. I need to set the size of the editable area in order to make `wrap`ing lines work the same in Neovim and QtCreator (aka `gj` and `gk` work correctly.)\r\nI couldn't find a way to set this size, I even asked it here: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/15269/how-to-set-get-size-of-editable-area-in-a-neovim-client\r\nHow can I achieve this?",

I read the docs in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8455 but I don't get how it allows setting the editable area except for columns? If all introduced by that PR is reflected in docs (`ui.txt`) then it's just providing new ui event (things that come from nvim to the client) not new api functions (things that can be called from client in neovim). Please help me understand how can I set the size of the editable area with this PR.",
