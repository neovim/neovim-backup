All/most of the time the logic would match what they're already doing for their LSP servers. That's a strong indication that the \"project root\" concept should be a general thing, not tied to LSP to make it re-usable for plugins\n\nCurrent workaround to re-use that logic - assuming a client/server is running - is something like:\n\n```lua\nrequire(\"lint\").try_lint(nil, { cwd = vim.lsp.get_clients()[1].root_dir })`\n```\n\nOther use cases:\n\n- https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/discussions/1530\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- Have `root_markers` definitions as part of filetype plugins or buffer variable\n- Have a readonly `root_dir` or `project_root` buffer ~variable~ option or a function mirroring `getcwd` or something like that, which plugins can use to get the project root for the current buffer",

If I am creating a preview window for the quickfix list, I might want to create a scratch buffer, assign a cwd buffer option to that, and then use it to cache/setup other buffers in the same directory. Or if I want to do a grep based on other buffers in the same directory, using bcd would be more straightforward than manually hacking through bufname. It would also create a simple/universally available source of truth everything could point toward.\n\n(bcd could also be used for convenience functions for the user where, for example, you can create a new buffer and assign it a bcd on creation, then enter a filename to save it and use bcd to fill in where the filename goes to)\n\nWhereas root markers tells you what projects the buffer is associated with. If I'm doing a location list project grep for a buffer, I would want to know what root markers/root dirs the project is associated with, so I could use that to build out the file origins. This also points strongly toward root markers being an option rather than a buffer variable or something set in the ftplugin file, as a buffer option gives me predictable behavior I can build a \"project grep\" based on (or, alternatively, some kind of managed behavior in a Lua module).\n\n(The above also implies another question - Do you store the root markers? Root dirs? Both? If you only store the root markers, they would need to be resolved, which is a file system op, each time they are used)",
