All/most of the time the logic would match what they're already doing for their LSP servers. That's a strong indication that the \"project root\" concept should be a general thing, not tied to LSP to make it re-usable for plugins\n\nCurrent workaround to re-use that logic - assuming a client/server is running - is something like:\n\n```lua\nrequire(\"lint\").try_lint(nil, { cwd = vim.lsp.get_clients()[1].root_dir })`\n```\n\nOther use cases:\n\n- https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/discussions/1530\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- Have `root_markers` definitions as part of filetype plugins or buffer variable\n- Have a readonly `root_dir` or `project_root` buffer ~variable~ option or a function mirroring `getcwd` or something like that, which plugins can use to get the project root for the current buffer",
