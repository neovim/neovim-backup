The problem is that `lua.vim.diagnostic.show` unconditionally (even if `update_in_insert` is `false`) hides the diagnostics:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/50284d07b6f020c819aeb07bfb30d88453e63b6d/runtime/lua/vim/diagnostic.lua#L1464\r\nand then schedules them to be shown after insert mode ends:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/50284d07b6f020c819aeb07bfb30d88453e63b6d/runtime/lua/vim/diagnostic.lua#L1477-L1481\r\n\r\nThe hide should be scheduled as well, not performed immediately.\r\n\r\n> Would need some minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\n1. use an LSP that publishes diagnostics while typing (as opposed to only when the file is saved), such as lua_ls\r\n2. set `update_in_insert` to false\r\n3. open a file that has at least one diagnostic somewhere\r\n4. press <kbd>o</kbd>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: I was quite annoyed by this issue, but even more annoying was the fact that any normal-mode edits (deleting a word, …) would spam me with diagnostics immediately, so locally I have a miniplugin that delays hiding/showing diagnostics until after the file is saved. It happens to work around this bug. Code here: https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/2e674efcf45140d911ac28fec87dddbb568cf47e/.config/nvim/lua/init/diagnostic_delay.lua\r\nIt'd be nice if neovim itself had an option to never update diagnostics until after the file is saved.
