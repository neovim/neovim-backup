The *nix version of this will be based on `lpstat`, `lpr` and some CLI based text formatting tool (I'm undecided between `groff` and simpler alternatives such as `nl` and `pr`). To date I implemented a function to query the system and get a list of available printers. Now I need to display that list in a floating window allowing the user to pick a printer of his choice and to set basic printing options (number of copies, front-back, line numbering enabled/disabled...) before launching the print job (which in concrete will translate to calling `vim.fm.system()` sending the selected buffer content on a CLI pipeline composed by one or more formatting commands and `lpr` in the end). Once the fallback printing is done for *nix OSs I want to do something similar for Windows systems too but since Windows is a little less \"CLI-friendly\" I have to investigate if I can obtain good enough results.\r\n\r\nIn the last days I was pretty busy with my job and my studies and I wasn't able to make meaningful progress so for me any contribution is more welcome now than ever.",
