    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe build instructions for OpenBSD reference a [closed issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2445) from ten years ago, don't really describe the build problem, and suggest a somewhat convoluted work-around.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the trouble building currently boils down to this from `cmake/Deps.cmake`:\n\n```\n# When using make, use the $(MAKE) variable to avoid warning about the job\n# server.\nif(CMAKE_GENERATOR MATCHES \"Makefiles\")\n  set(MAKE_PRG \"$(MAKE)\")\nendif()\n```\n\nIf the `set` is commented out, the build works. It seems like cmake runs `make` internally for a makefile build (makes sense), but some targets under `deps` need `gmake` (luajit is the one that I always see fail). `MAKE_PRG` is set to \n\nMaybe we can at least update the description of the problem in `BUILD.md`. We could suggest installing ninja as a work-around (I've also tested this, and the build works).\n\nAlso, maybe we should revisit the lines above. I don't know what the comment is referring to, so I don't know how to fix it, but maybe an additional condition could work? Only replace `MAKE_PRG` if it hasn't been set to `gmake`, perhaps?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`BUILD.md` contains modern build instructions.",
