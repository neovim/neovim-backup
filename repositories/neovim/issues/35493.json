    "body": "### Problem\n\nHello! I am now migrating from lazy to `vim.pack` and I have this question: `nvim-treesitter` recommends adding this `build` field to always keep parsers up-to-date. `build` field is executed when plugin is installed or updated:\n\n```lua\nreturn {\n\t'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter',\n\tbuild = ':TSUpdate',\n}\n```\n\nI don't really see how it can easily be implemented with 'vim.pack'. For now I just omitted this `:TSUpdate`, but I don't think it's a good idea in the long run. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI can suggest the following design:\n\n```lua\nlocal status = vim.pack.add {\n\t'https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter',\n}\nif status.updated then\n\tvim.cmd.TSUpdate()\nend\n```\n\nI do like the imperative approach very much. It makes the process of installing dependencies more obvious. But if you can expose some information about what was done during the process, it will help to make different things easily without lazy-like magic.\n",
