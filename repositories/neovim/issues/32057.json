I think jumping [count] matching pairs down or up is more useful. I therefore propose to map this as default to the (new) mapping `%-default`. This issue can be used to discuss this new default.\n\n### Problem\n\nNo easy way to jump 5 'elseifs' down.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWith cursor on 'if', 5% moves 5 ifs down. This can wrap around, or jump to the end if there are no 5 other groups.",

Which does not seem that useful to me.\n\nI use it frequently.\n\n> I think jumping [count] matching pairs down or up is more useful.\n\nThat seems pretty special-case, since `%` is often about \"pairs\" where it toggles to/from the start/end instead of advancing to the \"next\" item.\n\nThat will be addressed more generally once we have the ability to repeat motions. Meanwhile, a workaround is (could make this a mapping):\n\n    qq%q[count]Q",
