The only thing in my keymap is a bind of leader to space.\r\n\r\nAda is the only language this happens in.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nMy keymaps.lua:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.g.mapleader = ' '\r\nvim.keymap.set('n', \"<leader>pv\", vim.cmd.Ex)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect that Ada should behave like the other languages I use where this is not an issue. C, Haskell, OCaml, Swift, etc.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nunsure\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14.5 and Arch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nAlacritty 0.13.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256colour\n\n### Installation\n\nBrew and Pacman",

Last time I just send a ZIP to Bram and he did the rest.\n\nThis Is The Way, except now chrisbra has taken over as main maintainer and prefers to work via Github.\n\nSo the best thing is to open a PR to vim/vim updating the bundled Ada runtime files (ftplugin, autoload, syntax, indent, whatever you have) from your plugin (pointing out that you are the runtime file maintainer, in case it's not obvious from the file headers). There may be some requests for changes to match general runtime file standards, but usually such updates are merged quickly.\n\nIf you don't want to do that, explicitly give someone else willing to make such a PR permission (comment in an issue is enough, as long as it can be linked from the PR.)\n\nOnce Vim updates their runtime files, we will port the patches as a matter of course.",
