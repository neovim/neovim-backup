    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen writing custom complete function for `nvim_create_user_command` in Lua, the plugin has to filter completion by themselves. This has a big problem to both users and plugin authors.\n- Plugin authors have to write a bunch of boilerplate to filter candidates based on user-set `'ignorecase'`, `'wildoptions'`\n- If plugin authors don't do that, then users will be confused if their `'ignorecase'`, `'wildoptions'` are not respected\n\nThis is already supported if plugin authors use `\"custom\"` and Vimscript function name, but I only want to use Lua lambda and list\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI think there should a field `complete_filter` which a boolean which tell Nvim if it should filter completion candidates using default mechanism or leave that to plugins. Or completion candidates should be filtered by Nvim by defaults",
