Even if I don't even hit enter, just typing will trigger the behavior\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nMy config looks like this for the diagnostics signs:\n\n```\nvim.diagnostic.config({\n  signs = {\n    text = {\n      [vim.diagnostic.severity.ERROR] = \" \",\n      [vim.diagnostic.severity.WARN] = \" \",\n      [vim.diagnostic.severity.INFO] = \" \",\n      [vim.diagnostic.severity.HINT] = \"󰠠 \",\n    },\n  },\n  virtual_text = false,\n  virtual_lines = false,\n})\n```\n\nYou can see video of the behavior below.\n\nTimestamps for easier understanding of video: **_0:06_** you can see the correct gutter signs displayed. at **_0:10_** you can see as soon as I hit w after :w the config goes away and resets to the system default.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02643bd6-4dc8-4a2d-934b-b7beb0292bf6\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFor my vim.diagnostics.config to stay persistent as intended.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A, Vi IMproved 9.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux/Hyprland\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nghostty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nArch User Repository",
