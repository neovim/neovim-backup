When I run 'make test' for nvim, if there is already core file(s) in /cores (not of nvim but of the program I'm currently working on), check_cores() in test/helpers.lua starts debugger (lldb) and shows a back trace of the core(s). This is quite misleading. Moreover, if I hit 'q' to quit the debugger the core file is **removed**!! In my opinion this is totally unacceptable. Some coredumps are not easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\nShould any users read test/README.md carefully _before_ running 'make test'?\r\n\r\nI believe check_cores() should be activated only if user explicitly asked for it (at least on macOS). Or modify check_cores() so that pre-existing core files are ignored (and not removed).\r\n\r\nOr rename the make target 'test' to 'test-for-ci' or such if the test is intended to be used only by CI and not by human users.",
