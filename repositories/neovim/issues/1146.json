    "body": "The use of `x` functions inhibits compiler optimizations by hiding the implementation in isolated compilation units. For example, the compiler can theoretically turn\r\n\r\n``` c\r\nstrcpy(dst, a);\r\nstrcat(dst, b);\r\nstrcat(dst, c);\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n``` c\r\nstrcpy(stpcpy(stpcpy(dest, a), b) c);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut not if `xstpcpy` (as we use) has external linkage. The result is that `strlen` must be called on `dst` for every `cat`. Attributes help, but not in this specific instance.\r\n\r\nThere has been some prior discussion on this:\r\n\r\n@aktau said (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1134#issuecomment-54714027)\r\n\r\n> we should try to define stpcpy on platforms where it doesn't exist, and use the platfrom-supplied stpcpy if possible. It's faster and the compiler knows what these functions do (same for mempcpy, for example).\r\n> \r\n> One \"way\" of doing that would be:\r\n> \r\n> ``` c\r\n> #ifndef HAVE_STPCPY\r\n> char *stpcpy(...)\r\n> {\r\n>   // ...\r\n> }\r\n> #endif\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n@ZyX-I said (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1134#issuecomment-54724403)\r\n\r\n> > But I'm not sure how this would interact with the automatic declarations generator, if at all. Any reason to believe changes are necessary, @ZyX-I?\r\n> \r\n> For a number of reasons (one of them is that I use lots of macros for defining functions) declarations generator is run on a preprocessed file, so it is fine as long as HAVE_STPCPY is defined either with -D argument known by cmake at the makefile generation stage or in some included file.\r\n> \r\n> AFAIR we already have some config.h file generated by cmake, that includes some similar things. Just listing the possibilities: generated Makefile will embed all globally enabled -D definitions known to CMake (except for INCLUDE_GENERATED_DECLARATIONS), as well as -I arguments so that preprocessor works, thus both locations are fine; even though I have strong opinion about where it will actually land without my advice.\r\n\r\nObviously this does not apply to the `xmalloc` family, nor `xmemdup(z)`, but it does to `stp(n)cpy`, `strlcpy`, `strlcat`, and at least one function I'd like to add to `memory.c`, `strchrnul` (https://github.com/splinterofchaos/neovim/commit/9a2cd2e4a417c2f52023d31eba792ceab656d2bd). In some cases, when `BACKSLASH_IN_FILENAME` is not defined, we could use [`strcasecmp`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcasecmp). \r\n\r\nGlibc actually ships with BSD functions, even on linux. For example, to get access to `strchrnul` requires this:\r\n\r\n``` c\r\n#define __USE_GNU\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n#undef __USE_GNU\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the question is: How could we modify the build system to detect these functions and how do we modify the source to take advantage of them, and is it worth the trouble?\r\n",

But, for just a few, I think something like the above would be fine.  We could then define `xstpcpy` as `stpcpy` in `memory.h` and skip the declaration, and then conditionalize the definition in `memory.c`.  It's a bit of work though, and I'm not sure about the real gain you're going to get from it.\n\nFor the second part, it's not actually `__USE_GNU` that you want, it's `_GNU_SOURCE` (see `man 3 strchrnul`).  My only concern is that somehow _GNU_SOURCE is getting defined project-wide and we start introducing Linux or _GNU_SOURCE-only mechanisms without properly providing alternate support on other platforms.  Since Travis CI can only really help us with Linux testing right now, we don't have a way of verifying that we haven't introduced a problem before merging.  I'd hate to define `_GNU_SOURCE` just before the include and undo it right after, because when folks start using Neovim as a library it could really mess their build up.  I'm sure there's a way to work around it, but again, I'm not sure it's worth the gain.\n",
