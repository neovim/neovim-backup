In vimrc plugins, configuration is often done be way of a global variable, which isn't great, but doesn't require plugins to be loaded at the time of vim initialization scripts.\r\n\r\nNow, the workaround is to just bundle some code that happens on VimEnter, but since VimEnter happens after buffer load, a large number of plugins fail to initialize the initial buffer, requiring additional workarounds (like attaching a colorizer to the current buffer with norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua, or re-triggering file detection for neovim/nvim-lspconfig).\r\n\r\nvim-plug triggers the User event after all plugins are loaded, so this might be useful builtin behavour, or perhaps we could standardize on a place for plugin configuration with a specific event.",
