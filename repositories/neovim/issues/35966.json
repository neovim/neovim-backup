However, I noticed that markdown files in particular have almost no highlighting at all. It seems only bold text and Headings are highlighted using the bold text (same color still). The end result is a monochrome wall of text:\n\n<img width=\"784\" height=\"585\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdf0da59-6565-4d0a-8d73-81d76e27008f\" />\n\nI appreciate a lot the minimalist approach for the default color scheme (that's why I use it in the first place), but I think for markdown files in particular, a touch of color would be beneficial to make it easier to scan and read. In particular, the text of the headings, and maybe the bullet- and enumeration points (i.e. `*` and `1.` not the actual text), quotes and code blocks could be highlighted with an accent color.\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n* Headings: Bold with accent color\n* The fences of the fenced code blocks (e.g. ```python and ```) could be highlighted\n* The delimiters for lists (*, 1., etc.) could have highlighting\n* the blockquote delimiter (>) could have highlighting.",

The default colorscheme is _intentionally_ \"monochrome\" (and, more importantly, consistent -- there's simply not a lot of structure in Markdown files that can be captured with standard highlight groups).\n2. The other bundled colorschemes are inherited from Vim so are obviously not tuned for treesitter highlighting.\n\nLuckily, there are many, _many_, high-quality colorschemes that are just one `vim.pack.add()` away; it's also not hard to make your own. (There's also https://github.com/OXY2DEV/markview.nvim for extra-fancy Markdown viewing.)",
