    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nMy usecase is that:\r\nI have an asyncrun like plugin that executes the content of a buffer meanwhile shows the result in a split window, so ideally I want to set the buffer of the result window to buftype=terminal, not `buftype=help` to have correct highlight for the terminal escape sequence string.\r\nAnd I dont want these buffers block `:quit` when there are two windows in a tabpage: one for the source file, one for the result.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no such option for buffers so that nvim can treat a buffer as help when it performans `:quit`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n> we would want a settable property of the window indicating it should be implicitly closed if that helps closing a tab/all of vim. This often comes up as an expected behavior of floats, but is something which should be opt-in to by plugins for any kind of window (split/float).\r\n\r\nsource: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22063#issuecomment-1410727791\r\nthat's what I want too.\r\n\r\n### more contexts\r\nI used to open a related issue: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22063, and I'm currently using a [hack way](https://github.com/haolian9/zongzi/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/natives/lua/windmill/engine.lua#L101) to achieve the goal: open the buffer as terminal, when the process exited, set the buffer type to help via `ffi::prepare_help_buffer()`",
