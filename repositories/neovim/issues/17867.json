Nothing will happen.\r\nNow type `:nnoremap <esc> :echo 'esc'<cr>` and hit enter\r\nNow pressing either `Esc` or `ctrl-[` on your keyboard will echo 'esc'.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'm guessing this is caused by #17825 or one of the follow ups.\r\n\r\nI assume my terminal emulator doesn't support distinguishing the keys (I've tried kitty and alacritty). In that case I would expect the old behaviour i.e. `:nnoremap <c-[>` works as if you had done `:nnoremap <esc>`.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nCurrently, mapping `<c-[>`, `<c-m>` and `<c-i>` seems to do nothing.\r\n\r\nMapping `<esc>`, `<cr>` and `<tab>` does work and both keys will trigger the mapping. Of course this means I could just change my mappings to use `<esc>` instead of `<c-[>` but I would rather not because in the future I might switch to a terminal emulator which can distinguish between these keys and then I would have to change the mappings back again.",

Also LSP mappings are often created only when an LSP client attaches to a buffer. This could make it difficult/confusing to ensure mappings are created in the correct order.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, my reason for creating this issue wasn't necessarily because I want these key pairs to be distinguished in kitty/alacritty. If they don't support it then I don't expect neovim to jump through hoops to make it work. My issue was that mappings of `<c-[>`, `<c-m>` or `<c-i>` no longer triggered when pressing those keys on your keyboard. With the 0.7 release coming soon I could see this causing some confusion when these mappings stop working for kitty/alacritty users.\r\nIn my opinion, it's not the end of the world if `<c-[>` and `<esc>` continue to do the same thing in certain terminal emulators. Just as long as a mapping of `<c-[>` is triggered when pressing `ctrl-[` on your keyboard.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I'm happily using https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17867#issuecomment-1079934289 so this isn't a problem for me anymore.\r\nHowever there may be users who don't follow neovim development closely and won't easily find such work arounds. I will leave it up to you guys to decide what, if anything, should be done about this before the 0.7 release and beyond.",

Maintaining weird workaround in Nvim core forever to save a few mappings in your config, is not a good tradeoff.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I did not word this very clearly. What I meant was even if the terminal emulator does not support distinguishing the key pairs, I want `:nnoremap <c-[>` to still work. I don't necessarily care about keeping the old behaviour exactly I just thought that would be the simplest solution for terminal emulators that don't support distinguishing the key pairs.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the situation before and after #17825 when using `kitty` to hopefully make the situation completely clear.\r\n## Before\r\nMapping `<c-[>` triggers when pressing `ctrl-[` on your keyboard. It also triggers when pressing `Esc` on your keyboard since both keys are treated the same.\r\nLikewise mapping `<Esc>` triggers when pressing `Esc` on your keyboard and it also triggers when pressing `ctrl-[` on your keyboard.\r\n\r\n## After\r\nMapping `<c-[>` does not trigger when pressing `ctrl-[` on your keyboard (or seemingly any other key).\r\nMapping `<Esc>` triggers when pressing `Esc` on your keyboard and also triggers when pressing `ctrl-[` on your keyboard.\r\n\r\n# \r\nBasically what I want is for mapping `<c-[>` to trigger when I press `ctrl-[` on my keyboard no matter which terminal emulator I use (either one that supports distinguishing the key pairs or one that doesn't).\r\n\r\n",

And what key are you sending to nvim to trigger it?\r\n\r\n@justinmk - I have this mapped to select the right window pane (I use the Colemak layout, so `i` is where `l` typically is so it gets used heavily for navigation).\r\n```lua\r\nvim.keymap.set(\"n\", \"<C-i>\", \"<C-W>l\", {noremap = true, silent = true})\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI get that this is fixing a long-standing problem being fixed but it is still a breaking change that's confusing from a user perspective (well, at least some users). Is there a place in the documentation that explains this (if not, I might be able to contribute once I understand this a bit better)? It just seems like this could be a common point of confusion. It'd be really useful if there was a \"common mapping issues\" page somewhere (again, I'd be willing to spend a bit of time on this if you think it'd be useful here as well).\r\n\r\n(I didn't see anything obvious explaining this in [the map doc page](https://neovim.io/doc/user/map.html))",
