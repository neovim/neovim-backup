    "body": "### Problem\n\nSince the release of Vim9 in 2022, the biggest Vim feature that is not (and probably will never be) available in Neovim is Vim9script, not `ttymouse`. So I think it `:h nvim-from-vim` should specify that Nvim doesn't support Vim9script, and suggest users who write vimrc in Vim9script to switch to legacy Vimscript or Lua\n\nI know it has been mentioned in `:h vim_diff`, but I think that file is kinda long, so very likely users will miss it. Also it doesn't have a seperate tag for `vim9script`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nJust add a few lines to `:h nvim-from-vim` saying something like\n\n```vimdoc\n\nFor example, vim9script is not supported, instead Nvim support legacy |Vimscript| and |Lua| as first-class scripting languages. \nIf you want to share a |Vimrc| between Nvim and Vim, you should convert it to legacy Vimscript. \nOr if you want to keep Vim9script for Vim9, you can move legacy Vimscript code to a block like this >vim\n    if !has('vim9script')\n       \" legacy script commands go here\n       finish\n    endif\n    vim9script\n    # Vim9 script commands go here\n<\n\nOr you can maintain seperated Nvim and Vim config, which is more recommended.\n```",
