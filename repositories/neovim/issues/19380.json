I can understand when telescope pops up or fzf but it gets annoying when using completion plugins which can lead to issues like this one:\r\n\r\n[nvim-cmp issue](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/issues/309)\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nNeovim's window title flickers when going through menu entries using completion plugins like nvim-cmp.\r\n\r\n[nvim-cmp issue](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/issues/309)",
