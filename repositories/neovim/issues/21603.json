The decorations could be anything, but in practice they tend to be SVGs of different colors that are placed on top of characters to allow the user to reference a particular element with minimal work. Cursorless is most widely used by the voice coding community. See [this gif](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/blob/1a0616521bbc6d264f22fdad41e9a7773f9b0bee/images/bringArgueAirAndEachAfterDrum.gif) for an example of what the text decorations look like.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if neovim GUIs could support this type of text decoration, but I imagine it will require some server side changes.\r\n\r\nCross linking some related issues for posterity:\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1767\r\n- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/1144\r\n- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/669\r\n- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/850\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "@saidelike We discussed this before actually. It was me that suggested kui.nvim as a possibility. \n\nThe important distinction here is that kui.nvim uses the kitty graphics protocol (KGP). It doesn't actually rely on the kitty terminal (just happens the protocol was created by the kitty terminal author). As far as I know any terminal that supports KGP should be usable with kui.nvim. Another popular terminal is wezterm which works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and also supports KGP. It should work with kui.nvim afaik.\n\nAnother terminal graphics protocol that I think may eventually be more widely supported is sixel, which wezterm also supports, but the caveat is that there isn't an existing plugin like kui.nvim for sixel atm.\n\nWRT to using unicode and background colors, this is something I'd considered in the past, but I actually think it isn't ideal. There are a couple of reasons:\n\n1) I think a lot of people (including @saidelike ) will use cursorless+vscode for coding and cursorless+neovim only for terminal. The inconsistency between hats would be a significant cognitive overload imo.\n\n2) It is common for syntax highlighting in terminal output, which would be ruined by using background coloring imo. For instance if you use bat to cat a script file with syntax highlighting, you'd end up with an unreadable rainbow of syntax highlight colors and cursorless hat background colors. As a full time developer using cursorless for over a year I can say the various different colored hats above the text only is already enough of a mental overhead as is, let alone changing the actual color of the text glyph/background itself. Honestly even without syntax highlighting the resulting rainbow might make most things unreadable.\n\nThe only way I could see it being usable with unicode only and colors is if there is a way to only color the accents glyph over the character, but afaik this is not possible.\n\n",

I generally have way more code on screen than in their example, and commonly in two splits. Maybe I'm missing something about how else you are envisioning it though.\r\n\r\nThe idea is a little bit different, Let me elaborate:\r\nFirst lest draw a distinction, semantic highlight and syntactic highlight are used interchangeably, but in this case we need to draw the distinction:\r\n1. Syntactic Highlight: same elements in the grammar have the same color [semshi](https://github.com/numirias/semshi)\r\n2. Semantic Highlight: same names in the namespace have the same color [semantic-highligh](https://github.com/jaxbot/semantic-highlight.vim)\r\n3. Tree level Highlight: same depth level in the of symbols of the same type have the same color [nvim-ts-raimbow](https://github.com/HiPhish/nvim-ts-rainbow2)\r\n\r\nI don't have an example of 1 and 2 working together in neovim as they conflict but there is an example from intellij that has features 1 and 2 and a [plugin for 3](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets):\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/10254532/c00d1a45-508e-4cac-8add-044ecb9ad727)\r\n\r\nWith these 3 combined I think that there is sufficient colors in the screen to not run into conflicts most of the time. I think a fallback option is still needed. The main limitation is when the same variable is used several times in the same context and the variable names has few letters, for instance let's make an old stile for loop:\r\n```c\r\nfor (int id=0; id<3; id++) {\r\n    arr1[id] += 1;\r\n    arr2[id] = arr1[id] + 2;\r\n   //..\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example the variable \"id\" only has 2 letters so if you have 6 hats that leaves a maximum of 6*2=12 references in the screen at maximum, assuming the letters \"i\" and \"d\" are not occupied by other elements.\r\n\r\nThat's what I've said to me is the ideal situation, because the random color information of the hat would be greatly reduced being most hats a plain color, while maximizing the useful information of 1, 2, 3. But I understand the complexity of having it working properly for maybe not so much gain.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
