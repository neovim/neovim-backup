I'll sometimes have buffers open for files that don't exist in a session either because they are on an external drive that isn't mounted or in an encrypted volume that isn't mounted. When files suddenly exist, vim gives a warning (W13) and prompts for every single file whether to load or ignore.\n\nI think a setting like autoread but specifically for this case would be nice. Having it set would mean that no W13 messages would pop up, and it would be as if the user had chosen to load every file. That or some autocommand that could be used to prevent a W13 from happening. FileChangedShell is similar idea (though for all buffers) but doesn't execute when a W13 does.\n",

Should this \"Load All\" prompt _only_ disable W13, or should it apply more generally to: \"a modified buffer has had its underlying file changed, and we want to clobber the current buffer contents\"?\r\n2.
