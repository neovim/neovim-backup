    "body": "# Problem\n\nRelated: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30450\n\nCurrently there are lots of single-purpose APIs to get what may be called \"editor metadata\" about:\n\n- a buffer (not its text contents, nor extmarks (which is a big topic), nor its scripting state such as `b:`/`w:`/etc.)\n- a window (not highlight state or other \"big topics\")\n- a tabpage\n\nBesides just ergonomics (simpler interface + documentation), there are technical reasons why the above isn't ideal:\n\n- The `nvim_buf_x` paradigm was intended to behave like \"object methods\", but each call on such an \"object\" would invoke a separate RPC request (`buf.line_count`, `buf.is_valid`). That's not a great tradeoff, because metadata is very cheap, thus it's better to put all metadata into one response instead of requiring multiple RPC calls.\n    - Calculating this metadata is cheap so there's no reason to require separate calls.\n- Functions such as `nvim_buf_set_name` can trigger the swapfile ATTENTION dialog, yet there's currently no way to run it \"noswapfile\".\n\n# Expected behavior\n\n## For buffers:\n\n- Deprecate the API `buf_x` meta functions in favor of the existing `getbufinfo()`.\n    - *Or* provide `nvim_buf_get(filter:table)` which returns a superset (except `b:`) of `getbufinfo()`.\n- Introduce `nvim_buf_set(buf: int, info: dict, with: dict)`, which works like `nvim_open_win` on existing windows?\n    - ~~Doesn't look useful, only `name` would make sense.~~\n        - But `nvim_buf_set_name` has some side-effects which the caller may not want:\n            - can trigger the swapfile ATTENTION dialog, yet there's currently no way to run it \"noswapfile\".\n            - sets the alternate buffer\n    - The `with:dict` parameter would allow overriding and restoring various flags/options (internally uses `vim._with()`).\n- Eliminates:\n  ```\n  nvim_buf_is_loaded\n  nvim_buf_is_valid\n  nvim_buf_line_count\n  nvim_buf_get_name\n  nvim_buf_set_name\n  ```\n\n## For windows:\n\n- Deprecate the API `win_x` meta functions in favor of the existing `getwininfo(filter:table)`.\n    - *Or* provide `nvim_win_get(filter:table)` which returns a superset (except `w:`) of `getwininfo()`.\n    - *Or* augment `nvim_win_get_config(filter:table)` to provide any missing meta fields.\n- `nvim_win_set_config`, already exists, can we add a new optional `with: dict` param?\n- Eliminates:\n  ```\n  nvim_win_get_buf\n  nvim_win_get_cursor\n  nvim_win_get_height\n  nvim_win_get_number\n  nvim_win_get_position\n  nvim_win_get_width\n  nvim_win_is_valid\n  nvim_win_set_buf\n  nvim_win_set_height\n  nvim_win_set_width\n  ```\n- TODO: Not sure if we can eliminate:\n  ```\n  nvim_win_set_cursor\n  nvim_win_text_height\n  ```\n\n\n## For tabpages:\n\n- Deprecate the API `tabpage_x` meta functions in favor of the existing `gettabinfo(filter:table)`.\n    - *Or* provide `nvim_tabpage_get(filter:table)` which returns a superset (except `t:`) of `gettabinfo()`.\n- Introduce `nvim_tabpage_set(tab: int, info: dict, with: dict)`\n  ```\n  info {\n    name\n    curwin // current window\n  }\n  ```\n  - layout? https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/24507\n- Eliminates:\n  ```\n  nvim_tabpage_list_wins\n  nvim_tabpage_get_win\n  nvim_tabpage_set_win\n  nvim_tabpage_get_number\n  nvim_tabpage_is_valid\n  ```\n\n",
