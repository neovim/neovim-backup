Also the common case where you actually need both, `vim.fs.abspath(vim.fs.normalize(path))`, is quite verbose. But I'm also not sure if introducing a shorthand `fs.resolve()` or something is the solution for it. I've always liked this helper function:\n\n```lua\nlocal function getfile(path)\n  local resolved = vim.fs.abspath(vim.fs.normalize(path))\n  return vim.uv.fs_stat(resolved) and resolved or nil\nend\n```\n\nBecause I find both the abspath + normalize verbose and `vim.uv.fs_stat()` not a readable alternative to something like `vim.fs.exists()`",
