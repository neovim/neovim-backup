One minor step towards that would be to convert the terminfo data in `src/nvim/tui/terminfo_defs.h` to some sort of structure. We could still keep the [update_terminfo.sh](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/2c16c849986794682a4776ff4ec100d00eeba5ca/scripts/update_terminfo.sh) script around, and just produce the \"structures\" as a build/bot task.",
