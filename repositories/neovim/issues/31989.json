Reimplement (the subset we actually need) based on\n\n* [lua-tui](https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-tui/blob/master/tui/terminfo.lua) (MIT, Lua)\n* [terminfo](https://github.com/docelic/terminfo) (MIT, Crystal)\n* [rust-terminfo](https://github.com/meh/rust-terminfo) (WTFPL, Rust)\n\n3. Replace terminfo parsing (which is fraught anyway) by terminal feature detection via control sequences (as `libvaxis` does).\n\n---\n### Originally discussed in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/31966\n\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\n\n<sup>Originally posted by **setjmp** April 23, 2019</sup>\nunibilium is licensed as LGPL 3, and such a license prevents certain types of deployment of neovim at large corporations which take license compliance very seriously.  I came to write this feature request not out of whim, but as a response to a hurdle that I and others are facing.\n\nI have not done a thorough review of all the third party dependencies, but AFAIK this is the only LGPL 3 blocker.  \n\nReplacing unibilium will increase adoption of neovim tremendously.\n</div>",

One minor step towards that would be to convert the terminfo data in `src/nvim/tui/terminfo_defs.h` to some sort of structure. We could still keep the [update_terminfo.sh](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/2c16c849986794682a4776ff4ec100d00eeba5ca/scripts/update_terminfo.sh) script around, and just produce the \"structures\" as a build/bot task.",
