    "body": "### Problem\n\nIt is currently not possible to ignore the `TextChanged`, `BufModified`, `CursorMoved`, `WinResized` and `WinScrolled` events for a certain buffer/window, even for the \"owner\" of that object. These events are processed once per event loop iteration, rather than when a change happens, so the usual `:set ei+=all -> do something -> :set ei-=all` pattern doesn't work. That pattern does work for other events and processing done by the owner, but it may be desirable to be able to ignore autocommands triggered by external processing as well.\n\n- An option focused solution be a local `'eventignore'`, with the caveat being that it applies to the window itself and its buffer. A global + buffer + window ( + tab)-local `'eventignore'` seems more appropriate, but we currently lack the ability for such an option (could be resolved by https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/29314).\n- A namespace focused solution could be the ability to set a namespace for a buffer/window, in which case we only process autocommands belonging to that namespace (currently still augroups). (This concept could also be used to prevent deletion of windows/buffers when not inside a ui_attach callback for that namespace. Currently the namespace needs to always check that its buffers/windows still exist.)\n- A more window focused solution could be some API to mark a window (and its buffer) to not be affected by autocommands (nvim_open_win() flag; we already have a boolean `noautocmd` for opening the window, could promote it to also accept a string `\"always\"` to ignore events persistently, or even the same format as `'eventignore'`, though at that point I think we should just go with the window-local option route). \n\nWhat also should be considered is e.g. [command-preview](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28856) \n\n> In the spirit of playing nice with external UIs, I think there needs to be a way to mark windows as ignored by command preview (if there isn't already), or maybe just have a class of window/buffer option combinations that should be ignored by command preview (e.g. nomodifiable+bufhidden=hide+buftype=nofile+is a floating window+...)?\n\nCould probably recognize `\"cmdpreview\"` as a pseudo event to ignore in a window-local `'eventignore'`.\n\nRelated: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27855#issuecomment-2585221113\n\nAny thoughts @justinmk?",
