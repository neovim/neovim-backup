This does not happen with `nvim --clean` but ... should nvim ever tell me that a file had been written to disk when it actually was not?\n\nFor me this happens with Rust files. I guess rust-analyzer messes things up. But should it be able to mess things up with nvim telling me, things are fine?\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHard to tell, unfortunately. :(\n\nI installed Lazy and then the Rust LSP. ... But that's not my point. :)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen nvim tells me, a file has been written to disk, the file should be actually written and if something happens with some plugin, nvim should tell me, something broke.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nnot testen, since nvim --clean doe not show this\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian GNU/Linux Testing\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nfoot 1.21.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\n\"\"\n\n### Installation\n\nDeban testing",
