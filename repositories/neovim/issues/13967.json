In something like markdown you end up getting some weird things. The lines do wrap, however, for something like a blockquote you would get the following for a line (breaks at the space):\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n> \r\n日本語とか。。。\r\n```\r\n\r\n:help breakat  states the following --\r\n\r\n```\r\n'breakat' 'brk'\t\tstring\t(default \" ^I!@*-+;:,./?\")\r\n\t\t\t        global\r\n\tThis option lets you choose which characters might cause a line\r\n\tbreak if 'linebreak' is on.  Only works for ASCII characters.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know how linebreak works internally - but I wonder I summize the following logic may be enough:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif the character at the last column is any unicode character:\r\n    break the line\r\notherwise if the character at the last column is in the breakat string:\r\n    break the line\r\nfor any other case:\r\n    don't break the line\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it's possible to implement that kind of logic, in the case of Japanese and Chinese I believe this would work fine. It's literally just a long line of non-stop unicode. Perhaps other languages are similar but I'm not sure about that.\r\n\r\nよろしく！",

Perhaps give a setting for which ones?\r\n\r\nGives up some of the control of the `breakat` setting for unicode characters, but would be a large performance improvement. The other methods are to linearly search for the character in the string, initialize and fill a 65,536 large table, or use a hashtable. Exact control over broken characters is rarely used anyways.",

English also uses unicode characters. \r\n\r\nFor reference, I believe you are referring to unicode blocks as defined [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_block)?\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea that you have:\r\n\r\n1 - define which unicode blocks should break\r\n2 - break the line if the character at the last column is in a defined block from (1)\r\n3 - otherwise fallback to the default ASCII behavior of `breakat`\r\n\r\nI don't think there are a lot of blocks (read: languages) that need that kind of special treatment. For a languages that use mostly latin lettering, I believe they will use the normal ascii spaces etc and the default way vim wraps and breaks seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nIn regards to performance, I think it should be off by default and enabled by a setting. I'm sure a majority of vim/nvim users do not need this. I wouldn't have this on for a python file but I would turn it on for markdown, for example.",
