But since a `@variable.member` is also always a `@variable` then this is impossible?\n```lua\n  ['@variable']           = { fg = c.variable, italic = true},\n  ['@variable.parameter'] = { fg = c.variable, italic = true },\n  ['@variable.member']    = { fg = c.entity,   italic = false },\n```\nSeems to me (in accordance with general programming principles) that the child behavior should be able to overwrite the parent behavior...?\nMy `@variable.member` gets the `entity` color (as I want it to) but I can't get it to **not** be in italics.\n\n",
