Currently we fetch a prebuilt `xxd.exe` from https://github.com/neovim/deps/blob/master/opt/xxd.exe , but this has the following problems:\n\n- it's not ideal in terms of obviousness\n- we are missing some updates to `xxd.c` since then\n- it's clumsy to update stuff in https://github.com/neovim/deps , so we only want to use it as a last resort\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/36363 demonstrates that these tiny one-file C sources are easy to vendor, and also have some advantages (analyzer checks). Our build system is also setup to easily build and include third-party vendored things.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSimilar to `tee.c` https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/36363 , we can include `xxd.c` :\n\nhttps://github.com/vim/vim/blob/77cfc49060a50daefd1675b8a1dece0e6e943384/src/xxd/xxd.c\n",
