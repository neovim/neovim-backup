    "body": "### Problem\n\nUsers of the Roslyn LSP (used for C# in VS Code) have encountered significant delays when retrieving pull diagnostics in large documents while using Neovim. For instance, diagnostics in a 2000-line .cs file can take over 20 seconds to display after edits in Neovim, whereas in VS Code, diagnostics for the same file are displayed almost instantly.\n\nAs [@mparq noted](https://github.com/seblj/roslyn.nvim/issues/93#issuecomment-2508940330) in https://github.com/seblj/roslyn.nvim/issues/93, VS Code leverages additional parameters specified in the [LSP documentation for textDocument/diagnostic](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#documentDiagnosticParams), specifically:\n\n- previousResultId\n- identifier\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen requesting diagnostics, Neovim should include the `previousResultId` and `identifier` parameters as part of the request.\nThese parameters enable the server to utilize caching and return incremental results.\n\nSupport for maintaining state is already present in the [textDocument/semanticTokens implementation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8f84167c30692555d3332565605e8a625aebc43c/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/semantic_tokens.lua#L289).\nA similar mechanism could probably be implemented in `textDocument/diagnostic` handler.",
