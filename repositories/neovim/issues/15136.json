It is useful to have similar events to detect when text is put in the buffer (for example, with `p` or `:m`).\r\n\r\n`TextPutPre` and `TextPutPost` were mentioned in <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/4448/>.\r\n\r\nI don't know if `TextPutPre` is really necessary.\r\n\r\n`TextPutPost` should be triggered in the [`do_put` function](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/v0.5.0/src/nvim/ops.c#L2809-L2816), after updating the `'[` and `']` markers.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI wrote a plugin to highlight text when it is pasted from the clipboard. It uses the [paste handler](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.paste%28%29) to detect when something is pasted ([code](https://github.com/ayosec/hltermpaste.vim/blob/0.2/lua/hltermpaste.lua#L1-L24)). However, there is no way to detect when a user put something using a command (for example, `\"xp` to put contents of the register `x`).\r\n\r\nWith the `TextPutPost` autocommand event, it will possible to handle those cases. \r\n\r\nAlso, it can be useful to include a default implementation for this event, similar to [`vim.highlight.on_yank()`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.highlight.on_yank%28%29) for `TextYankPost`.\r\n",

The only missing feature is a way to detect if the change is from a *put* command (like `p` or `\"rgP`), or from anything else (like text added in INSERT mode, the undo action, etc).\r\n\r\nMaybe, instead of adding new events, a better solution is to add `v:event` data to `TextChanged`, similar to what is available for [`TextYankPost`]. Thus, we can use `v:event.operator == 'p'` (or something like that) to detect if the event is triggered by a *put* command.\r\n\r\n[`TextYankPost`]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/autocmd.html#TextYankPost\r\n\r\n",
