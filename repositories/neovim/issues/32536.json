Right now we have no \"caching\" of luals, meaning that if we change even a single file in `test/` we'd need to run luals on all lua files under `test/` which takes 20 seconds for me. The core problem is that it's not possible to use luals on a single file, which IIRC cmake needs as it can't reliably depend on a directory. I'm willing to try it out though if people still think it's worth adding to `make lint`, if it does turn out to be a bad idea we can always revert it.",
