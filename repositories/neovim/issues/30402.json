However the rendering of the cursor when on these characters is not consistent with the previous double width characters, e.g. emojis:\r\n\r\n- Cursor doesn't take up two columns\r\n- Visual selection doesn't account for the extra column\r\n\r\nSee below:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46614f4d-0c69-456c-998d-427fac0f8ee5)\r\n(blank space in visual selection, should look like this:)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee86c25c-26ac-4b19-bb24-97c3df7f2fc9)\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`nvim --clean` `:edit foo` `iüóπ<Esc>`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe new double width characters act like emojis, where the cursor takes up two columns which prevents the weird rendering\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-nightly+b6e350a\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.1\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nNixOS, linux kernel 6.10.7\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.36.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from source",

This is a neovim issue. Nowhere in the unicode spec that I can find does it say extended_pictographic characters must be rendered wide by default. Indeed, the extended_pictographic characters include characters like ¬©Ô∏è and ‚ö® which are obviously not to be rendered wide by default. You for some reason have decided that the intersection of extended pictographic characters and codepoints above 1f000 should be rendered wide by default. What is the justification for this? I can find nothing in the unicode standard that says anything about this neovim specific set of characters.",
