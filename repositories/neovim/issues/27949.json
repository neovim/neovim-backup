    "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nThe \"remote plugin\" model currently is too complex, and 99% of the complexity provides very little benefit.\r\n\r\n- Lifecycle is complicated, unnecessarily hard to test, troubleshoot, and explain to plugin authors.\r\n- _Every_ \"remote plugin host\" must implement 1000s of lines of code to solve the _same problem_ in _every API client_. This is a pointless waste of time.\r\n    - Example: _all of the code below_ is just for the \"remote plugin\" implementation in:\r\n        - `node-client`:\r\n            - [neovim/src/plugin/](https://github.com/neovim/node-client/tree/e03e409a5e61713259148cb5f83e1b85420a9343/packages/neovim/src/plugin)\r\n            - [decorators/src/plugin/](https://github.com/neovim/node-client/tree/e03e409a5e61713259148cb5f83e1b85420a9343/packages/decorators/src/plugin)\r\n            - [neovim/src/host/](https://github.com/neovim/node-client/tree/e03e409a5e61713259148cb5f83e1b85420a9343/packages/neovim/src/host)\r\n        - `go-client`:\r\n            - [nvim/plugin/](https://github.com/neovim/go-client/tree/2163acbdee29ae71daea9e154219de5bb3ef9dc7/nvim/plugin)\r\n    - The benefits of the extra code are\r\n        1. \"multi-tenancy\" (one node process for all node rplugins).\r\n        2. \"decorators\" can be used in the remote module to define Nvim commands/autocmds.\r\n- Too many moving parts, too many concepts.\r\n    - why is a \"plugin host\" needed?\r\n    - why can't I just call `vim.rplugin('node', 'path/to/index.js')`, then call functions defined in the remote process?\r\n    - why do I need \"decorators\" (`@pynvim.plugin`) ? why can't I just use Lua to define commands/events in `plugin/foo.lua`?\r\n        - `@pynvim.command('MyCommand', …)` vs Lua `vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('MyCommand', function(...) vim.rpcrequest('MyCommand', ...))`\r\n- `:UpdateRemotePlugins` and the \"manifest\" are extra state that must be resolved, refreshed, and healthchecked.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\n- Reposition \"remote plugins\" as \"remote modules\". For example, a Node.js \"remote plugin\" is just a Node.js module that (1) imports [\"neovim\"](https://github.com/neovim/node-client/), (2) can be started as a Nvim RPC client, and (3) handles requests from Nvim.\r\n    - Users no longer need to globally install `neovim-node-host`.\r\n    - Client defines RPC method handlers via `setHandler()`.\r\n    - Client calls `setup()` (placeholder name) which attaches and calls `nvim_set_client_info()` with the `methods` defined by `setHandler()`.\r\n- Eliminate the \"host\" / \"client\" distinction. The client is the host (it can handle requests from Nvim).\r\n- Drop \"multi tenancy\". Each plugin starts its own client (\"host\"). Plugins do not share a \"host\".\r\n- Drop host-specific \"sugar\" for registering Nvim-side commands/autocmds (aka \"bindings\"). Plugins define commands/autocmds in Lua, like any other Nvim plugin. The commands call methods in the remote module.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Implementation details</summary>\r\n\r\nFrom `doc/remote_plugin.txt`:\r\n\r\n> Plugin hosts ... take care of most boilerplate involved in defining commands, autocmds, and functions implemented over |RPC| connections. Hosts are loaded only when one of their registered plugins require it.\r\n\r\nWe can address the above use-cases as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Remote-plugins are just plain Lua plugins (`plugin/foo.lua`) that start API clients and call functions on the client.\r\n    - Eliminates all the unnecessary complexity of trying to find `foo.js`/`foo.py`/… plugin \"mains\".\r\n2. Make it easy from _Lua_ to start _any_ API client and treat it as a \"remote host\".\r\n    - One (API client) process per plugin.\r\n        - **Future:** Consider \"sharing\" client processes in the future. Out of scope for now.\r\n    - Eliminates all the redundant, per-platform (js/py/…) impls that implement a \"remote host\".\r\n    - Drop the concept of a \"plugin host\". We only need _plain old API clients_, not a \"plugin host\".\r\n    - Nvim Lua stdlib will provide (once—_not_ in every API client!) an ergonomic interface to:\r\n        1. start a \"known\" API client\r\n        2. allow the caller to specify the path to the remote-plugin \"module\" or \"main.\r\n        3. define commands/autocmds/functions that call remote functions.\r\n            - \"Decorators\" are not need for this! If it's painful to do this in Lua, _fix that once, in Nvim_ instead of \"fixing\" it N times in every API client!\r\n    - Examples (compare to `:help remote-plugin-example`):\r\n      - [go-client example](https://github.com/neovim/go-client/pull/172/files)\r\n      - pynvim example:\r\n        \"Remote\" Python code:\r\n        ```python\r\n        import pynvim\r\n\r\n        def main():\r\n            pynvim.setHandler('command_handler', command_handler)\r\n            pynvim.setHandler('autocmd_handler', autocmd_handler)\r\n            pynvim.setHandler('function_handler', function_handler)\r\n            # (placeholder name, TBD) \r\n            # Attaches and calls `nvim_set_client_info()` with the `methods` defined by `setHandler()`.\r\n            pynvim.setup()\r\n        main()\r\n        ```\r\n        \"Local\" Lua code:\r\n        ```lua\r\n        local rplugin = vim.rplugin('python', 'path/to/init.py')\r\n\r\n        vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('Cmd',\r\n          function(args)\r\n            vim.rpcrequest(rplugin.chan_id, 'command_handler', args.args, args.range)\r\n          end,\r\n          { nargs = '*' })\r\n        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({'BufEnter'}, {\r\n          pattern = {\"*.c\", \"*.h\"},\r\n          callback = function(ev)\r\n            vim.rpcrequest(rplugin.chan_id, 'autocmd_handler', ev.file)\r\n          end\r\n        })\r\n        function my_func(...)\r\n          vim.rpcrequest(rplugin.chan_id, 'function_handler', {...})\r\n        end\r\n        ```\r\n3.

Bun in particular claims much faster startup times and less memory overhead (and is more batteries-included with package management, testing and typescript compilation baked in).\n\nI did try to set things up in a way similar to this by setting up an init.lua entrypoint on the lua side with:\n```\nvim.fn.jobstart({\n    'bun', 'your-script.ts'\n  }, {\n    env = {\n      NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS = socket\n    }\n  })\n```\n\nand then using node client's \"attach\" mechanism on the node side.\n\n```\n  const nvim = attach({ socket: process.env.NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS });\n```\n\nThis got me the ability to manipulate nvim from bun. However, I got stuck on how to trigger bun code from nvim. So how to define a command for example.\n\nI think there is an rpc channel from nvim to node, so it should be possible to send things along it from the lua side and receive it on the node end.\n\nOverall this felt like a yak-shaving exercise for the actual plugin development so I didn't dig into it beyond this. But it would be nice to know how to set this up in a \"future proof\" way. Thanks, I appreciate all your work on nvim!",
