Open a file to edit in neovim.\r\n2. Open the same file in another editor and do some changes to it and write to the file.\r\n3. Run `:checktime` in neovim. If autoread is set, neovim will directly reload the buffer, else the user will be prompted for reloading the buffer.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nEvery time the user is prompted for reloading the buffer, there is no way of knowing what changes occured in the buffer. \r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nAfter implementing this feature, a diff between the buffer opened in neovim and the changed file would be displayed along with a prompt for whether the user wants to reload a buffer or not.\r\n\r\nI'd like to implement this feature as a part of the GSoC project for improving autoread.",
