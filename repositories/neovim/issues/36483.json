Call LSP jump to definition in the second window where the definition is located in the same buffer.\nExpected result: scroll to the definition in the second window.\nActual result: the first window got focus and scrolled to the definition instead.\n\nCase 2:\nEdit a file and open a copy of the file in a second tab. Split the tab and open another buffer (e.g. the header file). Call LSP jump to definition in the second buffer where the definition is located in the first buffer.\nExpected result: scroll to the definition in the first window of the second tab.\nActual result: the first tab got focus and scrolled to the definition instead.\n\n### Note\n\nCause:\n`vim/lsp/buf.lua:get_locations:on_response` implemented `reuse_win` as `w = vim.fn.win_findbuf(b)[1] or w` which forces it to always pick the first window if the buffer is opened.\n\nPotential fix:\nReplace with `tab drop` instead.\n```lua\n      if opts.reuse_win and #vim.fn.win_findbuf(b) > 0 then\n        vim.cmd(\"tab drop \" .. item.filename)\n        w = vim.fn.win_getid()\n      else\n        api.nvim_win_set_buf(w, b)\n      end\n```\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.12.0-dev-1575+gded5786252",
