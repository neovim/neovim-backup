    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen sending very large completion lists to a GUI client that supports ext_popup with text input going at the same time, it's possible to trigger a race condition that causes neovim to return one of the completion results with the same message id as we expect for the RPC result response. I've attached a log with a debug trace of some of the RPC transactions happening between neovim-gtk and neovim that seem to cause this. [race-reproduced.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17877569/race-reproduced.txt)\n\nI managed to do some bisecting on neovim and tracked the breaking change down to dc37c1550bed46fffbb677d343cdc5bc94056219\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI know, I'm really sorry :(. There's supposed to be some steps here, but I am going to need a bit of assistance from y'all in coming up with a reasonable way to reproduce this without pulling in my whole setup. I'm going to do my best to figure something out next week or after Thanksgiving if I can, but hopefully this is a start and maybe you guys have some ideas on how I could come up with a simpler reproducer. I think the key is going to be figuring out how I can get nvim to spit out a super large list of completion results without having my .vimrc present or needing to be in a project source tree.\n\nAlso FWIW: The good news is I can reproduce this very reliably on my own system, as can a number of other people with substantially different setups than my own (and am going to ask anyone with an easy reproducer for this to make a post here)[race-reproduced.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17877567/race-reproduced.txt)\n. Anyway: I'm going to give you the steps I'm following locally here, and hopefully we can figure something out.\n\n* Have LSP setup on neovim, the LSP configuration I'm currently using is for rust-analyzer and the code I'm using to reproduce this problem is a kernel source tree here\n* Use neovim-gtk (hopefully other clients can hit this, but with how hard it was to find a consistent reproducer for this it's -probably- better just to use my client for now)\n* Open up a project where you can get neovim to generate a really, really big set of results for autocompletion. Ideally, it should lag things a bit.\n* Start typing such that neovim starts popping up completion results using neovim-gtk's ext_popup support\n* Repeat until it crashes and says it no longer can read messages from neovim.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nnvim_input should never return anything but a u64 in the response field when responding to an nvim_input call.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A (this is related to RPC, so...)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nFedora 40\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nneovim-gtk\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A (I think?)\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom fedora repository, but I can trigger it by building from source",

So, I think you need to include that fix in your biscting.\n\nIt's also possible that the fix was incomplete, or that there are two bugs, one which is much more rare. In Neovide we haven't observed that, probably because we were also able to get rid of the problematic `ext_hlstate` extension, so we don't deal with huge messages anymore.",
