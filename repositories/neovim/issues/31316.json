    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen sending very large completion lists to a GUI client that supports ext_popup with text input going at the same time, it's possible to trigger a race condition that causes neovim to return one of the completion results with the same message id as we expect for the RPC result response. I've attached a log with a debug trace of some of the RPC transactions happening between neovim-gtk and neovim that seem to cause this. [race-reproduced.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17877569/race-reproduced.txt)\n\nI managed to do some bisecting on neovim and tracked the breaking change down to dc37c1550bed46fffbb677d343cdc5bc94056219\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI know, I'm really sorry :(. There's supposed to be some steps here, but I am going to need a bit of assistance from y'all in coming up with a reasonable way to reproduce this without pulling in my whole setup. I'm going to do my best to figure something out next week or after Thanksgiving if I can, but hopefully this is a start and maybe you guys have some ideas on how I could come up with a simpler reproducer. I think the key is going to be figuring out how I can get nvim to spit out a super large list of completion results without having my .vimrc present or needing to be in a project source tree.\n\nAlso FWIW: The good news is I can reproduce this very reliably on my own system, as can a number of other people with substantially different setups than my own (and am going to ask anyone with an easy reproducer for this to make a post here)[race-reproduced.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17877567/race-reproduced.txt)\n. Anyway: I'm going to give you the steps I'm following locally here, and hopefully we can figure something out.\n\n* Have LSP setup on neovim, the LSP configuration I'm currently using is for rust-analyzer and the code I'm using to reproduce this problem is a kernel source tree here\n* Use neovim-gtk (hopefully other clients can hit this, but with how hard it was to find a consistent reproducer for this it's -probably- better just to use my client for now)\n* Open up a project where you can get neovim to generate a really, really big set of results for autocompletion. Ideally, it should lag things a bit.\n* Start typing such that neovim starts popping up completion results using neovim-gtk's ext_popup support\n* Repeat until it crashes and says it no longer can read messages from neovim.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nnvim_input should never return anything but a u64 in the response field when responding to an nvim_input call.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A (this is related to RPC, so...)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nFedora 40\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nneovim-gtk\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A (I think?)\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom fedora repository, but I can trigger it by building from source",
