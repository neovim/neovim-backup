This makes working with multiple projects difficult unless you use tabs or a [vim-rooter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter) style plugin.\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIntroduce a `:bcd` command that sets a buffer-local directory.\n\nbuffer-local directories and `vim.fs.root()` can potentially be used as a primitive for \"projects\"\n\nRelated: #8610 \n\nP.S: Emacs has buffer-local directories, but not window-local or tab-local ones.",
