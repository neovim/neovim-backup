This is what I do to reproduce the issue:\n1. nvim\n2. Type something in the current buffer: \"abc\"\n3.  `:vsplit`\n4. `<ctrl-w> <ctrl-w>` (to move to the recently created split)\n5. `:term`\n6. `:bp` (and this changes correctly the second split to the previous buffer containing \"abc\"\n7. `:bn` (which doesn't return to the terminal as it should)\n\nIf I use buffers that are not terminals, `:bn` and `:bp` work correctly, though.\n\nCan you reproduce this issue?\n",

But there's an unanswered question about what we should do with terminal buffers for `'nohidden'`: \n- should we ignore `'nohidden'` and keep the terminal running (this is contrary to the normal operation of `'nohidden'`)?\n- should we just restart the shell when the terminal buffer is revisited?\n",

I think it's a really nice feature to have a terminal buffer that I'm able to interact with within nvim, but if the application running in it (an ssh session for instance, or some interactive console) may be killed because it's not in a window, it defeats at least the purpose I use it for. Restarting the shell would therefore also not be useful.\n\nI guess that people will use this differently, so configurability is probably the way forward. However, killing terminal sessions is not a desired default behaviour.\n",

Though https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6280 seems like a more proper fix.\r\n\r\n> what we should do with terminal buffers for `'nohidden'`: should we ignore `'nohidden'` and keep the terminal running (this is contrary to the normal operation of `'nohidden'`)?\r\n\r\nThat's still an open question.\r\n\r\nBut the main issue here appears to be resolved.",
