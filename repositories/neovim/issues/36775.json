            "body": "I think, if implemented, this should be an option given to commands that create a scratch buffer, not something you set after. Because:\n\n1. You can already have the desired behavior if you simulate a scratch buffer from a normal buffer while minding that `filetype` that triggers the check is set before `buftype`:\n\n```lua\nlocal function scratch()\n  -- create normal buffer\n  local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, false)\n  -- set filetype which would trigger lsp\n  vim.bo[buf].filetype = \"json\"\n  -- simulate scratch buffer\n  vim.bo[buf].buftype = \"nofile\"\n  vim.bo[buf].bufhidden = \"hide\"\n  vim.bo[buf].swapfile = false\n  -- lsp is attached\n  vim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(buf)\nend\n```\n\n2. You won't have desired behavior on a scratch buffer with the new `lsp-autoattach` if you set it later than something that checks the condition:\n\n```lua\nlocal function scratch()\n  -- create scratch buffer\n  local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)\n  -- set filetype which would trigger lsp\n  vim.bo[buf].filetype = \"json\"\n  -- set option too late :(\n  vim.bo[buf].lsp_autoattach = true\n  -- lsp is not attached\n  vim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(buf)\nend\n```\n\nSo instead it could be `vim.api.nvim_create_buf(<listed>, <scratch>, [<allow_lsp>])`. **However**, your suggestion about a separate option is good because it persists. Which means, if there is a plugin that lets you save scratch buffers between sessions, the LSP will attach on restore as well. So maybe we should have both.",

Then you can also have special type of scratch buffers that a server can attach to, while having others that it can't attach to. E.g. jdtls can attach to `jdt://` buffers which e.g. nvim-jdtls opens as `buftype=nofile`, but it can't attach to any arbitrary java scratch buffer.\n\nThe other aspect is the impact this has on plugins which currently check buftypes for whatever reason.\n\nAnd that it doesn't compose. E.g. with `buftype=acwrite` - which I use for `dap-eval://` buffers, which luals for example can attach to.\n\nImho we should support something like:\n\n```lua\nvim.lsp.get_config(name, function(conf)\n  vim.lsp.start(conf)\nend)\n```\n\nTo make it easier to handle the async properties of a config (currently root_dir), and then people can go nuts using ftplugin autocmd + some `if` conditions to guard the lsp.start call. No need to special case every possible scenario.\n\n---\n\nAlso note that if you already have a custom function to create a scratch buffer, if you know which server you want to attach to it, you could bootstrap the language server more directly using something like:\n\n```lua\nlocal buf = ... -- logic to create buffer\nlocal clients = vim.lsp.get_clients({ name = \"myserver\" })\nif next(clients) then\n  for _, client in ipairs(client) do\n    vim.lsp.buf_attach_client(buf, client.id)\n  end\nelse\n  vim.lsp.start(...)\nend\n```\n\n(untested)\n",

Some servers require files to exist on the filesystem to function, others don't. \n\nYou can't put the decision if a buffer is attachable for LSP solely to the buffer, it needs to be part of server specific configuration. \n\nThe only question here is to what degree we make configuring that more ergonomic. We could go the route of https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32037, or the one I proposed here. The trade-off is one is more specific and likely more convenient for users, the other is more flexible but requires a line or two more.\n\n",

If a user is starting LSPs on non-blank buftypes, it should be assumed they are taking responsibility for what they are doing.",
