            "body": "I think, if implemented, this should be an option given to commands that create a scratch buffer, not something you set after. Because:\n\n1. You can already have the desired behavior if you simulate a scratch buffer from a normal buffer while minding that `filetype` that triggers the check is set before `buftype`:\n\n```lua\nlocal function scratch()\n  -- create normal buffer\n  local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, false)\n  -- set filetype which would trigger lsp\n  vim.bo[buf].filetype = \"json\"\n  -- simulate scratch buffer\n  vim.bo[buf].buftype = \"nofile\"\n  vim.bo[buf].bufhidden = \"hide\"\n  vim.bo[buf].swapfile = false\n  -- lsp is attached\n  vim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(buf)\nend\n```\n\n2. You won't have desired behavior on a scratch buffer with the new `lsp-autoattach` if you set it later than something that checks the condition:\n\n```lua\nlocal function scratch()\n  -- create scratch buffer\n  local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)\n  -- set filetype which would trigger lsp\n  vim.bo[buf].filetype = \"json\"\n  -- set option too late :(\n  vim.bo[buf].lsp_autoattach = true\n  -- lsp is not attached\n  vim.api.nvim_set_current_buf(buf)\nend\n```\n\nSo instead it could be `vim.api.nvim_create_buf(<listed>, <scratch>, [<allow_lsp>])`. **However**, your suggestion about a separate option is good because it persists. Which means, if there is a plugin that lets you save scratch buffers between sessions, the LSP will attach on restore as well. So maybe we should have both.",
