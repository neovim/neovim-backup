            "body": "As I'm currently migrating from vim to nvim, I'm not totally familiar with every aspect of nvim, hence I might be missing part of the big picture. So here are some more details about my use case.\n\nI write my own colorscheme. And by colorscheme, I mean both\n- assigning color \"concepts\" to semantics (e.g. \"functions are drawn blue\") and\n- precisely defining the colors (e.g. my \"blue\" is `#90BAFF`).\n\nThe reason I insist on separating those points is that if I change my palette (e.g. to give it a more solarized-like look) I don't want my functions to suddenly turn yellow. My functions are and remain blue, whatever \"blue\" exactly means.\n\nNote that this is the perspective of someone coming from vim in a 16-color terminal. I've been happy until now with a reduced amount of colors to select from, as long as I can set their precise tone. So I would like to keep a similar workflow (and a similar look) while enabling gui/termgui modes where available (and keep the 16-color compatibility!), without\n1) having to copy the hex `#90BAFF` all over my colorscheme nor\n2) having to redefine that functions are blue when I switch the colorscheme (or more precisely the palette).\n\nSo it's both a question of keeping my colorscheme's source file DRY, and of tone-independent semantic highlighting.\n\n```vim\n\" what it looks like currently\nhighlight Function            ctermfg=blue  ctermbg=black guifg=#90BAFF guibg=#212022\nhighlight Special  cterm=bold ctermfg=white ctermbg=blue  guifg=#E0D9E5 guibg=#90BAFF\n\n\" what I typically would like\nlet v:colornames['Blue'] = '#90BAFF'  \" repeat for all well-known colors;\n                                      \" might also be a custom name like 'MyVeryOwnShadeOfBlue'\nhighlight Function            ctermfg=blue  ctermbg=black guifg=Blue    guibg=Black\nhighlight Special  cterm=bold ctermfg=white ctermbg=blue  guifg=White   guibg=Blue\n\" ...or even a way to set both cterm* and gui* values at once\n```\n\nI hope that my intent is more clear. Again, I'm new here and I might be missing the broader picture of colorschemes/palettes management in nvim. Or perhaps \"normal\" people just don't care that their functions remain blue when they switch colorscheme...\n\nP.S.: thanks for the reactivity!\n\n# EDIT\nI've found the function `nvim_set_hl`. I guess I can wrap it and set `gui*` values based on `cterm*` values and a dictionary of my custom colors. That's already a good step.",

To define your own, you can just do\n```lua\nlocal mygreen = '#A3BE8C'\n -- ...\nvim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'Foo', { fg = mygreen })\n```\n\nObviously, you could use a global variable for those instead  (`vim.g.colors = { ... }`).
