The file has not been changed, nothing touches the file except Neovim.\r\n\r\nI am using this both on the ZFS filesystem and EXT4, which are both shared by Samba.\r\n\r\nSince nothing but Neovim is touching the file, it has NOT changed in any way, and it should not continuously display this message.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nDescribed above.",

I am on Arch Linux, the easiest solution for me is to patch this out of Neovim completely, but it's really annoying because I have to keep up with upstream Neovim for updates.\r\n\r\nI think it really important to understand that the reason why Vim has this functionality to begin with, is because the author believes that Vim should protect the user from doing \"stupid\" things.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I don't want my text editor to protect me from anything. I use `rm` daily and if I want protection, I'll set it up myself.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this so-called protection clearly doesn't work when dealing with network shares, hence it should at MOST be an option that can be disabled.\r\n\r\nEvery time I save a file, which is about a gazillion times a day, because I do a LOT of writing, I have to press \"y\", and then another key to continue, after I already told Neovim to save the file. It happens so many times a day that it's driving me crazy, and there is nothing I can do on the network side because the difference in the timestamp is tiny.",

Why is it updating the file's \"modified time\" if it isn't modifying the file?\r\n\r\nIf am understanding correctly, the issue is that Vim and Neovim check the mtime to see if the file has changed since it was last read, and warn you if you are writing edits that were applied to a version of the file prior to the one currently on disk, as determined by mtime. What do you think the editor should do instead? The editor could hash the entire file on every read/write and use hash equality instead of mtime as the modified check, but this is a lot of overhead for large files, and I like my text editor to be able to work with GB-sized files at least in principle.\r\n\r\nWe could check for modified status by:\r\n- compare file sizes\r\n- if file sizes equal\r\n  - if below some size (10 MB or something), compare hashes\r\n  - else use mtime\r\n\r\nAnother option is adding an Ex command, or changing `:w! %` to not show this warning.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/5936#issuecomment-1118871584",

The problem occurs when Vim/Neovim itself are saving the file. **Only** Vim is touching the files, nothing else is. But modified time is not that simple when you're working with files over a network.\r\n\r\n> That is the wrong theme, so no need to keep repeating it. Vim/Nvim definitely are intended to make editing pleasant and unanxious (hence 'undofile', 'swapfile', etc.), not a footgun.\r\n\r\nBut that's the point exactly. Having undo and swap are all options, I can enable/disable those. This feature, I cannot.\r\n\r\n> Can you confirm that you are getting this warning because an external factor changed _only_ the mtime (not the file contents)?\r\n\r\nIt's **only** Neovim that is touching the files. Nothing else, but you have to take into account how network sharing works, both on Samba and NFS, which is different.\r\n\r\nThis feature is not working as is should with network sharing and it's so simple, just make this feature an option. Let the user decide. Problem solved for all. There is no need to go around and around with this starting to debug Samba shares.\r\n",

At least for the currently quite old debian stable distribution this is the case. \n\nThe reason is: if someone writes a file client side on samba/cifs, the file gets a modification timestamp on the client, which caches this metadata. Then the file gets transferred to the server and gets a server side timestamp. This server side timestamp differs from the client side timestamp. It doesn't matter how exactly synchonized both times are, there is a difference and this is visible afterwards. \n\nThis server side timestamp is the valid timestamp and gets synchronized to the client at least after invalidity of its caches. \n\nThe cifs parameter actimeo is responsible for the validity time of the timestamp. That's the reason why actimeo=0 helps. But with actimeo=0 the cache gets disabled. This has other disadvantages. Big disadvantages. So this is not a solution. \n\nWhile it seems not feasible for me to change the behavior of samba/cifs to the one NFS uses (which does not have this problem AFAIK), it should be quite easy to change vim here. There should be some event/trigger if the file changes. This should then trigger an autoread. \n\nAfter writing the file, the user typically does not instantaneously edit the file again. It needs some seconds to do so. But the samba/cifs system changes the timestamp typically within a second. \n\nSo some trigger, which reloads the file on changed modification date, or even after a fixed one second interval, will almost always reload the still unmodified file, but with an updated modification timestamp. \n\nI'm not a vim expert. Does some have a clue if there is such kind of a trigger? \n\nA trigger watching for changed attributes would be the best option. But even a fixed ~1 second interval after writing a file and then autoreloading should be fine. ",

It was just meant as a hint.\n\nThe current \"solution\", the one you mentioned, skips any warnings even if the file has indeed changed. Doesn't it? I won't call this a solution. It's a workaround - and probably a really bad one, I think. \n\nMy approach would be a simple configuration change and would be a quite better workaround: suppresses the warning if the file content wasn't changed but give a warning if it has changed. Yet I do not know if it works at all, as I do not know if scripting within the vim/nvim configuration is possible in this way. \n\nAnd, as you said, it's not needed for those who think using `:write!` (with an exclamation mark) is acceptable for those cases where the user typically uses no exclamation mark. \n\nAnd yes, my first sentence was a question, if this is still the case with current neovim versions, as I do not use neovim at all. As this closed issue does not refer any fixes and I didn't check newer versions (referring to \"debian stable\" should be clear a statement). However, in the meantime, I checked a newer version (standard Arch Linux package, version 0.11.3-1) and the issue itself is still present.",
