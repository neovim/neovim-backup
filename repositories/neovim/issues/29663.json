There's a lot of value in being able to uniquely identify windows and buffers for a vim session, so without surrounding context that lets you know you can confidently recycle a buffer doing so would lead to bugs. The signal of whether a buffer is a scratch buffer wouldn't work for this for the reason I gave. Even if you were to do something like enable the reuse of buffer ids of buffers that are wiped out (not just deleted), you still could introduce bugs where plugins store buffer-specific state outside of buffer variables that they would begin applying to the new buffer that claims the id.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've updated the original post that suggested reusing an existing buffer behind the scenes as one of two options, since thinking more about this I'm more worried about that being correct in all uses of this function. Letting a buffer be passed through pushes the responsibility for the correctness to the caller.",

For example, buffer commands such as `:sb` and `:bw` when an ID is passed. Though I'm not claiming that a workflow that is heavily reliant on buffer ids even being exposed is a good idea.\r\n\r\nPerhaps related - what is the max possible value for a buffer, window, and tab page id? If it's int32 or uint32, what happens when the id reaches its max value? If buffers and windows are seen as throwaway objects that are discarded and recreated rapidly I could see these limits being reached in a long-lived editor session w/ a plugin that churns through buffers / windows very carelessly.",

Maybe N = 1, but I'm not sure how much we should rely on that -- you've got completions, diagnostics, and you could imagine people having a few more in more custom configs. If we cut by 2 orders of magnitude, it's still unlikely to be hit, but it's not as comfortable as an int64. Sorry for derailing the discussion though -- your proposal above sounds good to me.",

            "body": "Adding some so far not mentioned aspects here:\r\n\r\n- `open_floating_preview` is a candidate for removal with a replacement that's not in `lsp.util`: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25272 and https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25514 (My preference would be to do that first, and basically block `open_floating_preview` for any extension whatsoever)\r\n- There'd be the previewwindow feature for cases where you want to have one unique preview. We could consider using that instead in a few places. There is also a PR to extend it to support float: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/26799\r\n- `open_floating_preview` is currently used for different features - hover, diagnostics, signature_help. If we recycle buffers we need to make sure that any state set from one feature is always reset. Should be doable, just to have it mentioned for the complexity assessment. And I don't know if this wouldn't be in some ways breaking if people relied on certain autocmd's. Or plugins could've cached the bufnr and relied on it becoming invalid if its gone.\r\n- I have in mind to change hover & signature help to support being moved from float to non-float, and if done, no longer auto-close on move to allow users to keep it open to be able to keep reading the docs while they're typing/moving around. Shouldn't conflict with any buffer recycling idea - but just to have it mentioned. ",
