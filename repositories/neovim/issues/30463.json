Currently, one has to manually revert any debugging changes made in each region once the problem is determined to be somewhere else.\r\n\r\nI realize this is \"out there\" but I find myself missing this feature frequently enough to at least ask.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nHaving some variant of `u` and/or `U` which would apply only to the currently selected region. The key binding is the least of the problem here. Undo would be linear (reverse order of changes) for all operations that affected the region. For operations that also had impact outside the region, it is a question whether to include them or not; I tend towards \"yes\" but that might need to be configured or controlled somehow.",

            "body": "Wow! I had no idea someone was working on this plug-in (I guess my google-foo wan't up to the task). Many thanks!\n\nI'm having some issues making it work though; I'm mentioning this here as it relates to the commands/bindings needed. Specifically, I can get `SelectUndoLine` to undo the last change to the selected region (I mapped this to `zu`), but I can't undo any changes prior to that. Calling `zu` again just undoes the previous `zu`, that is, restores the change that the 1st `zu` undid, so `zuzu` is a no-op. In this works similarly to the way `U` works (`UU` is a no-op).\n\nThat got me thinking that it would also be useful to have two commands, `zu` which undoes a single change (and repeated calls will undo older changes, so `zuzuzuzu` will undo 4 changes to the region), and `zU` to invoke `SelectResetLine` which would revert \"all\" changes to the region (and `zUzU` would be a no-op). That would be consistent with the way `u` and `U` work.\n\nThe trick is what to consider to be \"all\" changes. The way `U` works is that it undoes all the last set of consecutive changes to a line, not \"all\" changes since the file was last saved, or since editing started. In the context of a selected region, perhaps the same logic should apply, in which case, `zU` should undo all the last set of consecutive changes to the region?\n\nI also couldn't get `SelectUndoPartial` to do anything except move the cursor somewhere, but even being able to work in a line level is already great.",
