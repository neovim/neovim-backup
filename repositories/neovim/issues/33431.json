However, in some cases, the diagnostic text could fit on the line below without interfering with the text already on that line.\n\nExample:\n<img width=\"936\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2385b5d-240c-4739-a67a-3eb94199ae20\" />\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen the diagnostic could fit on the next line without overlapping with the existing text, it should do so, instead of always creating a new line.\n\nThe above example diagnostic could look like this instead:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/668f4718-485c-40a4-b4bc-913309eabb51)",
