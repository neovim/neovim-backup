    "body": "### Problem\n\nI made a GitHub CI action that runs `:checkhealth`, it can be used for plugins and for whole Neovim configurations. It's great for finding upstream issues in nightly, for testing a plugins own health.lua integration, and other things like that ([link here](https://github.com/ColinKennedy/nvim-checkhealth-gh-action)).\n\nHowever the current Neovim configuration for checkhealth has some pain points.\n\n1. `:checkhealth vim.*` checks for ripgrep as part of its work. A plugin maintainer is unlikely to be ripgrep related. So adding `nvim-checkhealth-gh-action` would be checking for something they have no interest in seeing. Even whole-Neovim-configuration may also not use ripgrep either.\n2. `:checkhealth vim.*` checks for optional providers, such as ruby, nodejs, python, perl. Most people don't use all 3, some don't even use even one of them (I don't, at least)\n\nBecause the current `vim.*` is a mixture of things that users are likely to want reports for (e.g. vim.deprecated) and things are a highly conditional (e.g. perl provide), I can't just have a \"set and forget\" default value for the CI runner.  Instead I have to hard-code, opt-in, to multiple sections like `vim.deprecated`, `vim.lsp`, etc, which means I won't receive auto-updates as other `vim.foo` sections are added or renamed in the future. And I also can't use `vim.health` because of that ripgrep check, which is likely to fail.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n(1) and (2) are basically the same issue. They're both useful checks but IMHO they should be in a separate section, not in `vim.*`. I recall that `vim.providers` used to be its own section, `providers`, outside of `vim.*` and using this issue as a case for why it and any others like it should be reverted.\n\nMy overall desire is \n\n- Able to point the CI runner to a single, generic checkhealth space that is most likely to  target vim-isms.\n- That string, whatever it is, to remain constant over time. But it can receive extensions over time. e.g. vim.foo might be added but `vim.*` is still constant\n- Receive auto-updates over time as more checks are added. e.g. `vim.bar` may be added in the future and we get the update because the CI's default string is set to `vim.*`\n\n#### Suggested, ideal fix\n- Moving the `External Tools` section of `vim.health` to its own section, such as `external` or something not within `vim.*`\n- Moving `vim.provider` back to `provider` or another name, not within `vim.*`\n\n#### Alternative, undesirable compromise\n- Move all `External Tools` + `vim.provider` to a nested name like `vim.external`. e.g. `vim.external.tools`, `vim.external.provider`\n- Move all other sections to a name like `vim.core`. e.g. `vim.core.deprecated`, `vim.core.lsp` `vim.core.health`, `vim.core.treesitter`, etc.\n\nBut note that the above isn't a great solution because again, `vim.bar` might get added and if the CI default value is set to `vim.core.*`, it won't get the update. So it isn't as good as the \"Suggested, ideal fix\" section.",
