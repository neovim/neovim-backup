Are these good enough? Do we need any sugar in the Nvim lua stdlib to encourage these patterns?\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTask or Promise abstraction:\r\n- \"Promise\" abstraction (or something better), maximally leveraging Lua coroutines + libuv.\r\n- \"Task\" abstraction (could this be avoided by overloading the \"Promise\" concept (or vice versa)?).\r\n- Function that creates an awaitable task from \"normal\" functions.\r\n    - Don't want to have to call `await` everywhere, that is a horrible result of JavaScript's async/await model.\r\n    - Instead, could something like `vim.system()` be \"promisified\" without its knowledge? Or could it handle differently when it detects that it's in a coroutine? So `vim.system()` would be synchronous normally, but `vim.async(vim.system, ...):wait()` would be asynchronous.\r\n\r\nStructured concurrency:\r\n- `await_all`, `await_any` (pseudo-names). See javascript's [Promise.all()](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all).\r\n- Programmer can handle errors and cancellations.\r\n- Programmer can cancel specific coroutines/promises.\r\n- Aggregate results\r\n    - This is something `jobwait()` currently doesn't help with.\r\n\r\n## Implementations\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/lewis6991/async.nvim\r\n- https://github.com/kevinhwang91/promise-async\r\n- https://github.com/ms-jpq/lua-async-await\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc\r\n- https://github.com/bitfield/script (example of \"pipeline\" interface)\r\n",

(e.g. `fun(..., callback: fun (err: any?, result: any?))`) For example:\r\n\r\n  ```lua\r\n  -- callback style\r\n  vim.fs.find(\".git\", function (err, path)\r\n    -- ...\r\n  end)\r\n  \r\n  -- async style\r\n  local a = vim.async\r\n  local async_find = a.syncify(vim.fs.find) -- this could perhaps even be done automatically by vim.fs.find if it sees that no callback is passed as last arg\r\n  local ok, path_or_err = pcall(async_find, \".git\")\r\n  ```\r\n- How to handle nested coroutines? Should the async coroutine forward yields to parent coroutines, on what criterion?\r\n- Should you be able to retrieve the result of an async function from a non-async context, e.g. through a callback?\r\n- How to handle multiple return values across async/sync boundaries (`return val1, val2`)?\r\n- Perhaps too early to even think about but I wanted to surface the idea anyway: Should user scripts perhaps be executed in a \"global\" async coroutine context? This would allow direct access to async primitives without users having to explicitly create async constructs.",

I think both behaviors should be supported, the standard way of using `coroutine.yield` directly, but also a way of suspending the entire call stack. I think this could be done by yielding a special constant, based on which the parent coroutine would decide whether to suspend or not, until it hits the main thread.",

I can see how functionality to race two or more operations, cancellation or waiting for multiple operations can be useful and the LSP stuff in neovim could probably benefit for some of it.

If there are patterns we can document without adding sugar, that is definitely preferred. So to close this, we can document those patterns.

            "body": "I have a lot of experience with this because I implemented the async library in plenary. The first iteration was basically a direct copy of https://github.com/ms-jpq/lua-async-await. It was not the best design because there is no point for async await with thunks. It felt like the extra thunks were just there to mirror the syntax from `javascript` or `rust`. `await` was literally implemented like this:\r\n```lua\r\nfunction await(f)\r\n  f(nil)\r\nend\r\n```\r\nIt was also much harder to pass async functions to higher order functions.\r\n\r\nThe new version did not need `async` or `await`, and you can call functions just like normal synchronous functions. Furthermore, higher order functions that expect synchronous functions just work like normal. There is also no extra syntax for for loops\r\n```lua\r\n-- now iterators just work like normal\r\nfor entry in readdir() do\r\nend\r\n\r\n-- instead of\r\nlocal iter = await(readdir())\r\nwhile true do\r\n  local entry = await(iter())\r\n  if entry == nil then break end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBack then I didn't realize that this was basically delimited continuations. Now, I think we should just implement algebraic effects using one-shot delimited continuations which is described in this [paper]( http://logic.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~sat/pdf/tfp2020-postsymposium.pdf) and implemented in [eff.lua](https://github.com/Nymphium/eff.lua). The issue with just using coroutines for converting callback based functions is that you don't get to use coroutines for anything else. With algebraic effects, you can have other effects in addition to async effects. Algebraic effects can implement  `Reader` (local configuration), `Exceptions`, `State` (local state), `Generators`, and more. Also, algebraic effects separate the effects from interpretation. For example, imagine some program using the file system effect, log effect, and read effect:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal handle = handler {\r\n  val = function(v) return v end,\r\n  [Log] = function(k, arg)\r\n    print(arg)\r\n    return k()\r\n  end,\r\n  [ReadFile] = function(k, path)\r\n    return k(fs.read_file(path))\r\n  end,\r\n  [Read] = function(k)\r\n    return k(config)\r\n  end\r\n}\r\nhandle(my_program)\r\n```\r\nIf you wanted to test your functions, you can change the interpretation to not use IO.\r\n```lua\r\nlocal vfs = {my_file = \"asdfasdf\", another_file = \"adfadsfdf\"}\r\nlocal logs = {}\r\n\r\n-- handle without IO!\r\nlocal handle = handler {\r\n  val = function(v) return v end,\r\n  [Log] = function(k, arg)\r\n    table.insert(logs, arg)\r\n    return k()\r\n  end,\r\n  [ReadFile] = function(k, path)\r\n    return k(vfs[path])\r\n  end,\r\n  [Read] = function(k)\r\n    return k(config)\r\n  end\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAsync could be implemented like this:\r\n```lua\r\nlocal handle = handler {\r\n  val = callback,\r\n  [Async] = function(k, fn, ...)\r\n    fn(k, ...)\r\n  end\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExceptions:\r\n```lua\r\nlocal handle = handler {\r\n  val = function(v) return v end,\r\n  [Exception] = function(k, e)\r\n    return e\r\n  end,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

This is a big drawback compared to the plenary/gitsigns implementations that uses a single coroutine for each context. It also requires `await` which isn't needed in the other implementations.\r\n\r\nI've created https://github.com/lewis6991/async.nvim which I'm using as a reference for all the plugins I use async in. The library is small enough that (for now) it's ok to just vendor directly in plugins without needing it as a depedency.",

We should focus on what feels right for a Lua + Nvim.\r\n\r\nI've been using plenary's async module with neotest for a while now and have found the lack of an async/await syntax to be much more fitting with Lua's simplistic style of programming. IMO adding async/await would be clunky. \r\n\r\n> Sounds like https://github.com/lewis6991/async.nvim is informed by a lot of previous work, which is a good sign! Does it provide a way to cancel tasks, handle errors/cancellations, and aggregate results?\r\n\r\nI wanted to introduce the async usage to nvim-dap-ui which is similar to LSP, where it's currently using a lot of callbacks. I worked off of @lewis6991's implementation and added the ability to cancel tasks and handle errors rather than them just being raised to the user. His implementation already covers aggregating results. It's very similar to Python's asyncio Task class just because I didn't want to have to design the API much. Also added some flow control primitives.\r\n\r\nImplementation here https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui/blob/feat/new-api/lua/dapui/async/base.lua and some usage in tests https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui/blob/feat/new-api/tests/unit/async/base_spec.lua.

            "body": "Thought I'd update as I've been having a bit of fun with this. I've done a fair bit of refactoring and adding of features in the last few days.\r\n\r\nThe main features are currently:\r\n1. Handling results and errors of [tasks](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui/blob/feat/new-api/lua/dapui/async/tasks.lua) along with cancelling.\r\n2. Helper functions for coordinating tasks, including gathering results from a list of tasks and getting the result of the first task to complete (and cancelling the others).\r\n3. Async versions of many libuv functions, pretty much the same way plenary does it with the added bonus of all of the functions being typed with emmylua annotations so users will have full type inference.\r\n4. Creating a [fully documented and typed LSP client interface](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui/blob/feat/new-api/lua/dapui/async/lsp-types.lua) which is generated by a script based off of the [LSP spec meta model](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/blob/main/protocol/metaModel.json)  and then implemented very simply with some metatables [here](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui/blob/feat/new-api/lua/dapui/async/lsp.lua). \r\n5. Async primitives (queues, events and semaphores) which are often useful in async code, again based off of Python's asyncio modules.\r\n\r\nNot sure if it's the direction core would want to go with an async library, (e.g. the LSP client but I was doing something similar for the DAP specification and LSP was mentioned as a key reason for the async usage so thought I'd slap something together for it). I think it does demonstrate the advantages of a single library  by implementing broadly useful features and providing a stable, tested solution for async that can be used by anybody.\r\n\r\nHere is some sample usage of the LSP client. Open the script in the nvim-dap-ui branch to see the type checking/documentation with Lua LSP\r\n```lua\r\nlocal async = require(\"dapui\").async\r\n\r\nasync\r\n  .run(function()\r\n    local client = async.lsp.client(2)\r\n\r\n    -- Notifications usage\r\n    client.notify.textDocument_willSave({\r\n      reason = \"3\",\r\n      textDocument = {\r\n        uri = vim.uri_from_bufnr(0),\r\n      },\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    -- Request usage\r\n    local symbols = client.request.textDocument_documentSymbol(0, {\r\n      textDocument = { uri = vim.uri_from_bufnr(0) },\r\n    }, { timeout = 1000 })\r\n\r\n    return symbols\r\n  end)\r\n  .add_callback(function(task)\r\n    if task.error() then\r\n      vim.schedule_wrap(error)(task.error())\r\n    else\r\n      print(vim.inspect(task.result()))\r\n    end\r\n  end)\r\n```",

After that it's a lot more subjective and could be done in a plugin. There is some work going on to get common dependencies like plenary added to rockspec so that users won't even have to specify the dependencies (For example https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest/pull/185) which would make keeping most of this outside core even more logical.\r\n\r\n> - treating async functions like first class objects (tasks with methods)\r\n> - job cancellation: this can be done by providing custom callbacks to libuv functions instead of wrapping them directly\r\n\r\nI would question these exclusions.

Not sure about the 8 other methods though, quite OOP.\r\n\r\nYeah as I said the interface was basically copying python so OOP is right :sweat_smile:  It could be trimmed quite a bit if we wanted. For example something more `pcall`-like could be:\r\n```lua\r\n---@class Task\r\n---@field cancel fun(): nil Cancels the task\r\n---@field trace fun(): string|nil Get the current stack trace of the task (if running)\r\n\r\nlocal task = async.run(function() end, function(success, ...)\r\n  if not success then\r\n    local err, trace = ...\r\n    print(err .. \"\\n\" .. trace)\r\n    return\r\n  end\r\n  local result = ...\r\n  -- Do something with result\r\nend)\r\n```\r\nAdding the trace as an extra argument because once the coroutine dies, the `trace` function won't work.\r\n\r\nWe could even just return the cancel function directly but returning a table leaves it more open to extending in future. I think the trace function is useful. For example I'm using it in the tests to get useful tracebacks on timeouts which plenary's async library doesn't provide.\r\n\r\nAlso the above loses the ability to add multiple callbacks but not sure if it'd really be needed (I've not needed it so far)",

The resolution was that we should just be more strict on naming conventions and/or annotate the code better with things like `-- @async`.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly this isn't something I've been very strict with in Gitsigns, but mainly because almost everything needs to run in an async context as it runs jobs all over the place. In some places I've started adding `-- @async`.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it's not very different from things like `api-fast` or `textlock` which are in essence just other forms of context.",

Also might lead to some surprising behaviour when calling from an async context but trying to provide a callback.\r\n\r\nSorry to be so verbose on this, just wanted to illustrate my thoughts.

For a more complete implementation I'm using https://github.com/lewis6991/async.nvim as a staging area. It includes a couple more things:\r\n- `async.sync`: (like `void`) but is intended to return its results via a callback. It returns a function of the signature `function(..., callback(results))`, so it works very much like a raw libuv function.\r\n- `async.join`: to use with `async.sync` to run multiple functions concurrently.\r\n- (Missing) job cancellation\r\n- (Missing) `async.pcall`\r\n\r\n> However, IMO, async-entrypoint(async.void) should provide the way to wait for the async completion.\r\n\r\nHow do you mean wait? You mean wait synchronously by blocking? That should be a pretty easy addition using `async.sync` with something like `uv.new_check`.\r\n\r\n> If async-entrypoint does not provide some some of the way, the user will not be able to wait for async-function.\r\n\r\nDo they need to be able to wait?

We can just as well create something like `async.run` if there's a real need. Not something I see myself using much.\r\n\r\n> Why does join call the thunk with a callback? Are you supposed to give it a thunk the is returned from create?\r\n\r\nYou are supposed to pass `join` a list of async functions above. The callback is needed so the user can wait on the result.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal main = async.create(function()\r\n   local results = async.join(math.huge, nil, {my_async_func1, my_async_func2})\r\n   -- do something with results\r\nend)\r\n```\r\n\r\n>What is this doing? Edit: it is for max number of concurrent tasks.\r\nWhy would that be useful?\r\n\r\nBecause some applications might not want to put too much strain on the event loop. I specifically wrote `join` to use in packer-v2, which has had many reports of issues when too many jobs are run in parallel.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, I think I will put the first two arguments to join in an `opts` field.\r\n\r\n> Why are we checking if the coroutine is running? We should just do what the function says it is doing, instead of changing depending on the context which is very confusing. We should only check if the coroutine is running to provide error messages to the user\r\n\r\nIt allows you to freely use functions wrapped in `async.create` in async contexts without creating more coroutines.

If I'm creating a new handle (by your naming) I'd expect it to create a new context (i.e. new coroutine). I don't think the core should try to be \"smart\". If an error occurs, the original async context also dies.

That's pretty verbose IMO. \r\n\r\nThe expectation is to do:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n\r\nlocal f1 = async.create(function(...) end), 1)\r\nlocal f2 = async.create(function(...) end), 2)\r\nlocal f3 = async.create(function(...) end), 1)\r\n\r\nasync.join({f1, f2, f3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: `join()` only works because `async.create` returns a callback-style function.\r\n\r\nOne of the main benefits of `async.create` is that it just returns a callback-style function, which means it can be used internally and exposed to the user without any API-dependency on the assync lib as it just becomes an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n> If you want to run functions in async contexts, just run the inner closure! I don't see any boilerplate.\r\n\r\nThat requires you to create 2 versions of every function you want to run in both contexts. That was a problem I had in gitsigns, which was made worse by having a debounced version added to the mix. It simplified things a lot to just hide the async stuff, as it didn't matter.\r\n\r\n>  However, having functions expect different arguments depending on the context is very confusing. I also don't think leaf async functions should fallback to accepting a callback, they should just fail when not called in the proper context.\r\n\r\nTo me the whole point of the async lib is that the async aspect is almost completely abstracted away. Wrapping a function in `async.create` is basically like adding `-- @async`. I'm simply saying this function **will** run in an async context, whether one is provided or not.\r\n\r\nTo me, it's similar to luv's API where every async function as a sync version where the callback is passed as `nil`.\r\n\r\nFor functions that don't return anything, they only difference is that one is blocking; they both execute the function as normal, no pesky unnecessary runtime errors. When there are return values, non-async returns its data via a callback, whilst the other returns normally. I don't see this as a significant enough difference to consider it confusing. I'd rather minimize the potential for runtime errors.\r\n\r\nWe could make it an error to pass a callback in the async-context? That would cover a good fraction of erroneous use cases.\r\n\r\n> I also think we should try to remove the argc stuff. I think we can remove it as long as the callback is the first argument?\r\n\r\nThat would basically force every use of `wrap` to pass a closure, so I'm pretty against that. I've at least made `argc` optional (default to 0). We could extend that further and redefine `argc` as `callback_pos` so we can support arguments before **and** after the callback. Then it would be fully optional. Not sure if this would complicate things too much.\r\n\r\n> As one of the goals is to keep the core minimal, are you planning on keeping the protected argument for wrap? Seems like it's pretty niche, and could be implemented with pcall if desired.\r\n\r\nThis area is a bit unfinished, but ideally we should aim to remove the argument and pass it some other way.\r\n\r\n> I agree with this. If I'm creating a new handle (by your naming) I'd expect it to create a new context (i.e. new coroutine). I don't think the core should try to be \"smart\". If an error occurs, the original async context also dies. This also means that if you're in an async function, you must block for all async calls made, it's not possible to start a task and not wait for it (and so actually run couldn't be written with create).\r\n\r\n> I'd say this is a point towards not using async.create. Not defining functions wrapped with create leaves the user to decide how it's run.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to position the API as a little higher level to what It seems you're expecting, which is fine, maybe we can have both?\r\n\r\nIf we don't have `async.create` then we shouldn't have `async.wrap` either. If we follow this then we end up with:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nfunction M.run(func, callback, ...)\r\n  return execute(func, callback, ...)\r\nend\r\n\r\n-- Note: We could detect the type of arg 1 here. If number, then treat as argc, \r\n-- else treat as func and set argc = 0. The Lua stdlib does this kind of thing in a few places.\r\nfunction M.wait(func, argc, ...)\r\n  return coroutine.yield(argc, func, ...)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is simpler than what I've got currently (though also a lot more limited).\r\n\r\nHowever, we can then build `create` and `wrap` on top of this.\r\n\r\nSo best of both worlds?\r\n\r\n> Actually alternative idea is to add some extra logic to wrap to catch errors in wrapped functions and re-raise them in the coroutine that called them. That way no custom pcall is required, the built-in works as expected which I think would be a really nice addition\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a good idea. I think it should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Those are the fundamental building blocks and other plugins can add their own abstractions over those, such as `create` etc. We can then add more functions back in as needed.",

It implements async/await and full promises implementation with `promsie.all`, `promise.allSettled()`, `promise.race`, etc. and passes standard promise tests. I've been using it and prefer it to plenary's async barebones futures way.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the nvim solution shouldn't aim for simplicity but use established patterns and provide all the tools for async including synchronization, etc.\r\n\r\nHere's  [Semaphore and mutex with promise-async](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-fundo/tree/main/lua/fundo/lib) CondVar wouldn't be much work to implement. The author has also made [async vim.loop wrapper using promises](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-fundo/blob/main/lua/fundo/fs/uvwrapper.lua) which I use.\r\n\r\nYou don't need Neovim-specific knowledge to use `promise-async` since it's modelled after JS so the web is full of guides and patterns for it.\r\n\r\nI think `promise-async` would be a solid example for core with added functionality on top. Personally, I'll stick with it over any core implementation unless core features surpass those of `promise-async`\r\n\r\nPython async uses futures and tasks and asyncio/asyncfile, JS promises, so why should Neovim core not aim for the same level of  features and usability?",
