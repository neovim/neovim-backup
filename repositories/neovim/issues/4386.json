    "body": "- Neovim version: 0.1.2\n- Operating system: Arch Linux\n- Terminal emulator: Gnome Terminal\n### Actual behaviour\n\nVim `:set wrap` has always soft-wrapped at the window border. Neovim follows this behavior\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI would be able to like to have a `:set wrapwidth=80` and have Neovim softwrap at the 80th column, even if the window is 120 characters wide.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. `:set wrap`\n2. Type a lot\n3. Resize window (the wrap follows the window)\n\nIf this could be implemented I'd greatly appreciate it. I've found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/989093/soft-wrap-at-80-characters-in-vim-in-window-of-arbitrary-width) stack overflow question about it but haven't found a solution that works when I have multiple windows open. If it were built into Neovim I think it would be nice.\n\nA way to implement this would be an internal border feature where users could set an internal border for a window. If they could set the internal border such that the window is always 80 characters wide it would achieve the same thing. In my eyes this would work similarly to the Goyo plugin but instead of having a border around the whole view, each window could have it's own local border.\n\nIf I'm missing anything let me know. I've been looking to do this or a while but haven't found a way.\n",

This taints window navigation, also some plugins: e.g. aurum when committing by default displays diff in the biggest window adjacent to commit one, this will much likely be “wrap” window.\n2. This solution shrinks status line. Also do not forget that something needs to be done to border window’s status line.\n3. This solution makes some `:windo` commands more complex, and if one hides the presence of windows it is easy to forget to add an `if`.\n4. This solution will hide _all_ `~` characters, not only characters in the border window, making it impossible to see where file ends without `&number` or something like this.\n5. This solution will hide _all_ window borders.\n\nThis is not a duplicate of #3784, there authors implicitly said he wants one Neovim window, here author explicitly said he wants more. So this issue can be WONTFIX, but not DUPLICATE of #3784.\n",

Goyo goes a long way towards solving the issue, but doesn't work well with multiple windows. Having multiple windows is an okay hack, but is hard to deal with when you want soft wraps in multiple windows.\n\nRegarding the two options above, I originally liked the second option since it makes working with split windows significantly easier and what I would expect from an editor, but it should be easy to implement an autocmd that resets the buffer soft wrap width on window resize, so the first option seems good enough.\n",
