Unfortunately accessibility is not so simple and we also\nneed to check for difference in luminance between the different colors.\n\nLuminance is the [lightness of a color][1] and, for the worst case of\ncolor-blindes, is the only way they distinguish colors.\n\nThere are a lot of differente [type of color blindness][2] but usually, or at\nleast how I was tought, we create our color palette by reducing the saturation\nof color at zero. This is done to ensure that we guide the user's eyes to the\nright thing. Turns out having a good luninance ratio between colors make\nreading clear for everybody.\n\nTo see what I mean leat's but the colors side by side and we try to reduce the\nsaturation to zero:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6ce95a-1401-406b-9c32-b6f05db284cf)\n\nAs we can see, the colors became basically the same grayish color. \n\nAnother more allarming thing is that the foreground has more contrast that any\nother color. The issues with this is that we want to use color to highlight\nimportant things so they pop up more to the eyes of the users. In the current\nscenario a colored word is actually more difficult to read since the majority\nof the text has more contrast.\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Classification\n\n# Light Palette\n\n| Color Name | #RGB | Contrast Ratio | AA R | AAA R | AA B | AAA B |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Foreground | `#14161b` | 15.19:1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Blue | `#004c73` | 7.73:1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Blue | `#007373` | 4.76:1 | :white_check_mark: | | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Green | `#005523` | 7.58:1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Red | `#590008` | 12.34:1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Yellow | `#6b5300` | 6.15:1 | :white_check_mark: | | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Magenta | `#470045` | 13.02:1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n\n## Luminance and Contrast differences\n\nThe light palette is in a much more state where with some colors we don't even\npass some tests.\n\nHere the problem described above is much worse because the contrast between\ncolors is even more drastic and sometimes thing become really difficult to\ndistinguish between one or another.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9d82e0-96a8-4669-a97f-8443647429a1)\n\n# Colors Hue Problems\n\nWhile it is a good thing to use neovim's color. It is a lot harder to make the\ncolorscheme accessible since the hues of the primary colors (blue, cyan and\ngreen) are too similar, witch makes really hard to distinguish syntax element\neven for people with normal vision like myself.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMake design and luminance ratio between colors more accessible.",
