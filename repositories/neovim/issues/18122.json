By default, a narrow filename string is interpreted using the ANSI codepage (CP_ACP). In Windows Desktop applications, it can be changed to the OEM codepage (CP_OEMCP) by using the SetFileApisToOEM function. You can use the AreFileApisANSI function to determine whether filename is interpreted using the ANSI or the system default OEM codepage.\r\n\r\nThus, the easiest approach would be for us to replace the builtin `loadfile()` with our own function behaving more or less like zeertzjq's snippet, on windows. We should do this early at startup before `--cmd`, so user can still override it.\r\n",
