It should be possible to configure which client have priority to handle actions like `textDocument/signatureHelp` or `textDocument/hover`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAll available clients are requested and results are passed to handler. In case of `hover`  or `signatureHelp` this causes unexpected focusing of floating window (handler does not support multiple results, it populates float with results form first client, then it overrides them with results from second client and it assumes that `hover` was triggered twice).\r\n\r\nThere are other issues, for example with`'textDocument/rename' (current implementation prompts for new name multiple times than applies multiple renames showing `Buffer  file:///xxx.py  newer than edits.`). \r\n\r\nIt is possible to define noop handler as a workaround for example:\r\n```lua\r\nlocal noop = function() return {} end\r\nlsp.jedi_language_server.setup {\r\n    handlers = {\r\n        ['textDocument/documentSymbol'] = noop,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlsp.pyright.setup {\r\n    handlers = {\r\n        ['textDocument/hover'] = noop,\r\n        ['textDocument/signatureHelp'] = noop,\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut this still requests all clients which is not necessary.\r\n\r\nSide note: IMO the function `vim.lsp.buf_request_all` shoul be renamed (`buf_request_and_apply`?) as current name is misleading. Then `buf_request` could be renamed to `buf_request_all` (as doc describes, it is \"used for requesting all active clients\") and `buf_request` or `buf_request_single` could be implemented for requesting  first available client (according to some configurable ordering).\r\n\r\n### Log file\r\n\r\n_No response_",

For hover, querying first available server seems to be the simplest working solution so I would start with this and later consider more sparkling features (toggle is a nice idea). The problem I see with current multiple server support is that `lsp-handlers` are 1:1 to clients, so to customize merging/displying results from multiple servers, user must override the whole request.\r\n\r\n> I think rather than renaming/expanding the buf_request style functions, we should do away with the middleware and directly call client.request.\r\n\r\nYou just mean something like moving [this code](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/lua/vim/lsp.lua#L1333-L1366) directly [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/buf.lua#L46) and removing buf_request style functions?
