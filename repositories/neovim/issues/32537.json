Progress report is currently only used by LSPs in core so for other plugins that would want to report progress, they need to either fake being an LSP or use the private APIs.\n\nSome other usages of progress report APIs could be:\n- progress of external formatters (https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim/issues/250 -> workaround available relying on `noice.lsp.progress`)\n- progress of external linters (https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint/issues/366 -> api available you can hook yourself on a plugin)\n- progress of task runners plugins or user tasks (`git push` and co for example)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nProvide a `vim.ui.progress` that could look like this:\n\n```\nvim.ui.progress({opts})\n    Starts progress report of an asynchronous action.\n\n    Example: >lua\n        local handle = vim.ui.progress({ name = 'Git push'' })\n        -- provide updates while the task is runnig\n        handle:update({ subtext = \"subtext\"})\n        handle:update({ percent = 75 })\n        -- task succeeded, clear progress report\n        handle:complete()\n        -- or signal a failure\n        handle:fail(\"error message\")\n<\n\n    Parameters:\n      • {opts}        (`table`) Additional options.\n                      • name (string) Name of the long running task\n                      • subtext (string|nil) Description/name of the subtask\n                      • percent (int|nil) If not null, percentage of progress of the task.\n\n    Returns:\n      • {handle}        (`table`) Handle to update the task.\n             • update (function(opts)) Change displayed information\n                          • name (string|nil) Name of the long running task\n                          • subtext (string|nil) Description/name of the subtask\n                          • percent (int|nil) If not null, percentage of progress of the task.\n             • complete (function) Mark task as successfull & remove it\n             • fail (function(string)) Mark task as failed, send an error message & remove the task\n```",

Added to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32084\nRelated: \n\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28809\n\nGetting the interface right is the main thing needed here, the implementation can be lifted from an existing plugin (why don't these plugins upstream stuff?). Your outline looks decent.\n\n- should `complete`/`fail` be a single function like `stop(status:'success'|'fail'|'cancel')` ?\n- do we need `cancel()` ? \n- `subtext` => `desc`\n- (orthogonal?) By default, `CTRL-c` should cancel whatever is in-progress.\n\n\nThe [vscode Progress interface](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/main/progress-sample/README.md) is also worth a look.",

Although nothing majorly wrong with returning a special object after initiating progress, it (arguably) has several issues:\n- Requires a dedicated design. Not bad per se, but trying to reuse existing approaches might be better.\n- Can be harder for users/plugins to override/reimplement. I assume this is meant to be overridable by plugins (like `vim.ui.select()`, `vim.ui.input()`, `vim.notify()`), so this should be taken into account.\n- Leads to more convoluted tests, as it would require transferring all test code to be executed in child process.\n\nThe suggestion mostly reuses already existing approaches of [LSP `workDoneProgress`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressReport) and loosely some basic Nvim's API/Lua functions (`nvim_buf_set_extmark()`, `vim.diagnostic.set()`, etc.). It can look something like this:\n\n```lua\n--- @param ns_id integer Namespace for progress source. Implementations can\n---   use to display information about the source (like name of LSP server)\n---   based on namespace's name. Can also be a string directly.\n--- @param token integer|string Token to identify specific progress report\n---   within namespace.\n--- @param kind 'begin'|'report'|'end' Stage of progress. Can also have `'fail'` if needed.\n--- @param opts? { title: string?, cancellable: boolean?, message: string?, percentage: integer? }\n---   Notes:\n---   - `title` is required for `'begin'` kind.\n---   - `message` can be used to show more detailed `#done / #total` progress,\n---     as is currently done by LSP servers.\nvim.ui.progress = function(ns_id, token, kind, opts) end\n```\n",

There are also progress events that only have meaning to a single buffer, like clangd's fileStatus event.\n\nIf the api in the plugin where to exist in neovim, I think it could be like this\n\nCreate a progress viewer/display:\n```lua\nlocal display = vim.progress.create_display({ --[[categories]]  }, { on_start = function(event)  end, on_update = function(event) end, on_end = function(event) end }) \n\n```\n\nSend progress event:\n```lua\nlocal event = vim.progress.create_event(srcid, category, { title = '...', --[[additional data]] })\nvim.progress.event_start(event)\n-- ...\nvim.progress.event_update(event, { message = '..', progress = 0.4 })\n-- ...\nvim.progress.event_end(event, { message = '..' , --[[...]] })\n```\n\nThis [plugin](https://github.com/drehren/fltprogr.nvim) implements a similar idea.",
