    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI have tried to work with neovim on a network location, and use Netwr to browse around in the current working directory (CWD), however, when I use it it show utter emptyness.\r\n\r\nThis bug seems to correlate with breaking down of the LazyVim config. Basically, when I launch Neovim with LazyVim, and use the find file or find text option to open a file, even though in the menus, proper things are displayed, when I open the files with them neovim opens a completely empty file. If I write something into said file, and write it, then Neovim replicates the the folder structure of the server in which the chosen file lies into the CWD. and puts next to the chosen file.\r\nSo for example I have a file bar.py at location Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::\\\\\\\\server\\\\...\\\\foo\\\\bar.py and I choose Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::\\\\\\\\server\\\\...\\\\foo\\\\ as CWD for my LazyVim session. Then choosing to edit bar.py will result in the opening of a completely empty file. Then if I save it, it will just put in the CWD the following folder structure server\\...\\foo\\bar.py next to bar.py .\r\nIn addition the nvim-tree plugin also fails to work the same way as the Netwr do.\r\n\r\nI highly suspect that the breakdown of the LazyVim config emerges from this bug of the Netwr. In addition, I suspect that this bug emerges from its broken support of UNC paths.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nnvim --clean .\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nInstead of the standard functionality of Netwr works in the current working directory, we get nothing it is used on a network location.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.9.5\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\n9.0\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro, Version 22H2 (OS Build 19045.3930)\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nwezterm 20230712-072601-f4abf8fd\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nnot defined\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nScoop",
