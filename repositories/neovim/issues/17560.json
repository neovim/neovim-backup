(Can be partiallly fixed by https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17558. The PR discussion shows there are still use cases where not everything is highlighted)\r\n  * Flags that are not titles, but are the first word in a line, are incorrectly highlighted. For example, the `-L` in the [tmux man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html) paragraph for `-S socket-path` is highlighted, because its the first character in its line (varies by terminal dimensions).\r\n* subcommand titles are not highlighted. For example, it would be nice to highlight tmux titles for `attach` and `detach`, and systemctl section titles for `start` and `stop`. Neovim bolds these titles based on roff formatting, but does not color highlight them.\r\n\r\nThe current syntax highlighting is done by per-line regex. Due to the nature of man pages being mostly plain text without symbols, it can be difficult to differentiate between a title and a paragraph using regex. Some possible solutions:\r\n\r\n* Someone smarter than me comes up with the correct regexes.\r\n* Parse the man page, instead of relying on regex. For example, [fish shell implements man page parsing internally](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/share/tools/create_manpage_completions.py).\r\n* Use external tool to parse man pages, such as [jroff](https://github.com/roperzh/jroff). This introduces a dependency.\r\n* Don't do this. This can be an external plugin. Probably doesn't make sense for treesitter, since man pages are read only and would not benefit from incremental parsing, but a standalone plugin can be created.",
