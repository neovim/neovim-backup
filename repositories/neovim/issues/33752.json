Create `test.lua`:\n   ```lua\n   for _, client in ipairs(vim.lsp.get_clients()) do\n       lsp.buf_detach_client(0, client.id)\n   end\n   ```\n2. `vi test.lua`\n3. Verify that `:checkhealth lsp` shows a lsp. Note the one client attached to one buffer.\n   ```\n   vim.lsp: Active Clients ~\n   - lua_ls (id: 1)\n     - Version: 3.14.0\n     - Root directory: nil\n     - Command: { \"lua-language-server\" }\n     - Settings: vim.empty_dict()\n     - Attached buffers: 1\n   ```\n4. Run the current file as lua: `:source`\n5. Run `:checkhealth lsp` again. Note how there are no attached buffers for the `lua_ls` client:\n   ```\n   vim.lsp: Active Clients ~\n   - lua_ls (id: 1)\n     - Version: 3.14.0\n     - Root directory: nil\n     - Command: { \"lua-language-server\" }\n     - Settings: vim.empty_dict()\n     - Attached buffers: \n   ```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`lsp.buf_detach_client` stops the corresponding LSP client + server when the client is no longer attached to any buffers.",

And worse, you can run into races and corrupted state files if one process is still shutting down (and saving files on disk), while another is starting up if you close + re-open quickly.\n\nImho auto-close shouldn't be done without opt-in. And the opt-in can be done with some autocmd's without much boilerplate.\n\nSee also discussion in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14430",

It does seem like it's worth revisiting the topic, because that issue was closed with a now obsolete [comment about neovim core not supporting heuristics to start language servers](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14430#issuecomment-1848355381).\n\n> And worse, you can run into races and corrupted state files if one process is still shutting down (and saving files on disk), while another is starting up if you close + re-open quickly.\n\nInteresting! IMO, this race condition feels like a reason to put some logic into neovim core. Not auto-close, but some logic to ensure that we don't start a LSP when that very same LSP is still in the process of stopping. Once we've resolved that core issue, then I feel like we could revisit the topic of if it makes sense to auto-close LSPs immediately (or after some delay) once they're no longer attached to any buffers. What do you think, @mfussenegger?",
