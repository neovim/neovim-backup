Either way, though, what's released in an Ubuntu version is what will be there for that Ubuntu version (unless serious bugs get reported).\n\n> Not sure why the stable ppa is old\n\nFor the same reasons I mention in the previous paragraph -- dependencies. Backporting a bunch of dependencies to the older Ubuntu releases is a time sink I haven't had the bandwidth for lately, especially since it requires a lot of the rust stack for tree-sitter. The stable PPA is intentionally based on the real Debian packaging so that there is a clear upgrade path to the real packages if/when a newer version becomes available in the distribution.\n\nHonestly, at this point I should probably just get rid of the stable PPA.",
