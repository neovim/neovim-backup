But I suppose adding them now as part of the ui2 module can only help in designing appropriate options.\n\nI can imagine treating output from the command line as a special message kind, whose targets should become configurable. Whether detected by the ui2 module as before (was quite hacky/prone to error I think), or as part of the msg_show event (I'll check if that is possible/more reliable).\n\n> I agree it would be better to not \"silently\" change defaults.\n\nAgreed: #37924\n\nSince it's not going to become default yet I don't think any ui2 work needs to block 0.12 (so the milestone doesn't really matter?).",

It may not even need to be configurable: If you ask explicitly for output, put it in the pager. (At the very least, I think that would be a strict UX improvement over the status quo, at least with `target = 'msg'`.)\n\nI agree that autodetection is hacky and should be avoided; the end goal here should be for every core `msg_show` event to be annotated (and for plugins to similarly annotate their output).",

The biggest open issue left is with `cmdheight=0` and `vim.print` (or rather `:=`), which gets routed to the msgbox -- which means the output is ephemeral. That is almost never desired (to test, set `cmdheight=0` and do `:=vim.o.rtp`).\n\nYes, although sometimes I have the opposite need: it's enough for me to see a few multi-line messages (~ `:lua vim.print(('x\\n'):rep(50))`) disappearing after a few seconds in the message area and I display them with `:msg` (if they were recorded in history), only if I really need to look at them closely. Now they consume more attention than the old way.\n\nI don't have an idea yet for a good balance between both needs.",
