The example there starts with `:vimgrep`, but `:make` would also be amenable to this.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch already implements what you're asking for in a very well-designed way. Use its `:Make` command instead of `:make`.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/tarruda/vim/issues/2",
