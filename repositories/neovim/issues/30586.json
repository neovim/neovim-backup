    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim uses a hidden internal composition order, which determines the order the floating windows with the same z-index are drawn. Many UIs, including the very widespread telecope relies on this order to build the UIs. In particular, a there's no alpha blending between the windows of the same z-index, the last window in the index will always be used.\r\n\r\nA GUI like, Neovide, need to respect this order and do the same type of rendering, or things will look wrong. So that's in fact what we are doing right now, I reverse engineered the algorithm and duplicated it in Neovide [here](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2612). But it only works when the UI is connected from the start, and we receive absolutely all the events. It's also very fragile.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe internal composition order is exposed in the UI protocol.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Another solution would be to require the whole plugin world to stop using overlapping z-indices. But this does still not work correctly in Neovide, because then we need a way to control the shadow casting and blur. Threating the whole z-index as one layer, is much easier to understand and does not require plugin authors to add additional Neovide specific annotations.",

And it should be the same as the `comp_index` But, note that it's currently not updated when multgrid is enabled.\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/20251be15a4ad3f6e7016450ca3338d52b2f0951/src/nvim/grid_defs.h#L104\r\n\r\nI think that `anchor_grid` should remain an independent property, which, that should only affect the position. For example, you might want to render two windows side by side, and on top of some kind of frame window. So, you use anchor for position them next to each other, and the order to draw on top of the other window.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note, is that the whole `comp_index` is unspecified and dependent on the implementation. But many plugins rely on the current implementation.  And at least this PR, will change a bit how it works https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/30259",
