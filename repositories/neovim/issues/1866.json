So the command above would open neovim just as if it was on your host (but in a container) so perfectly safe for trying out and playing with! This is also exactly how I currently use vim on my computer. You can add any additional `-v` flags for loading local code files etc you want to edit in the container.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` console\n$ docker run -it \\ \n   -v /path/to/your/.vimrc:/home/user/.vimrc \\\n   -v /path/to/your/.nvimrc:/home/user/.nvimrc \\\n   -v /path/to/your/jessies-code:/home/user/jessies-code \\\n   neovim\n```\n",

I did see the [deps](https://github.com/neovim/deps) repository and the makefiles so maybe it's easiest to infer it from there.\r\n\r\nThere are some great examples by @jessfraz in one of her [repo's](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy to start on the CI box but I'm unsure of where to begin package-wise.\r\n\r\n",
