    "body": "### Problem\n\nMy first instinct when using this tool on my small laptop display is to find a\nfile i want to look at in the quickfix window, hit enter on it to diff it and close the qf\nwindow so I have more display real estate to view the diff windows vertically.  That use\npattern is not currently supported. What happens is:\n\nWhen closing the quickfix window opened by the plugin, the autocmds created by the plugin\nare deleted and an empty list is added to the quickfix history (`:h :chistory`). Despite\nthe original quickfix list generated still technically being available (via `:colder`),\nthis effectively ends the usefulness of that list because the `BufWinEnter` autocmd was\nwhat triggered the file diffing when navigating the list.  After that it just becomes an\nordinary quickfix list, i.e. `:cnext` just shows the file.\n\nThis is intentional.  However does it need to be?  Perhaps it is for the sake of cleanup?\n\nIf you drop the `WinClosed` autocmd that is on the quickfix window (it was calling the\n`cleanup_layout` function and also closing the left diff window) and remove all code\nreferencing `layout.qf_win` inside `cleanup_layout`, then that quickfix list remains functional\nwhen closing and reopening the qf window--at least until one of the diff windows is closed\n(which also does the cleanup).  Maybe there is a use case where this would cause a problem?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nClosing the quickfix window has no effect on the functioning of the difftool.",
