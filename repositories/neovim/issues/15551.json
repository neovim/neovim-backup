Maybe with `completepopup` ?\r\n\r\n### Feature description\r\n\r\nI believe neovim should add the support to have borders configurable for pum windows. Floating windows and other things like it are able to have their own borders and configurations for them, but pums do not yet. \r\nI couldn't find anything on the google or any issue that relates to well shockingly because I feel it would be quite a nice feature to have. \r\n\r\nFor example completion menus, it would be quite nice to be able to turn on borders for them and you can set the characters or what not for those borders and colors.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I could be more specific. Thanks!",
