    "body": "### Problem\n\nI have a noisy LSP ([harper-ls](https://writewithharper.com/docs/integrations/language-server)) that I like being able to turn off when it's distracting. I want to \"turn it off\" for all current buffers and future buffers. I also want to be able to \"turn it on\", and not have to reload my existing buffers to see its diagnostics.\n\nIf this request is confusing, see the (now hidden) discussion between me and @clason starting here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33116#issuecomment-2837393934. The code in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33702 might also convey the idea more clearly than prose.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt sounds like `vim.lsp.enable` is really not meant to be the mechanism for this: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33116#issuecomment-2837765698.\n\nHowever, I also don't think that `vim.lsp.start`/`vim.lsp.stop` is the right tool for the job here either: I want this to affect all future buffers as well.",
