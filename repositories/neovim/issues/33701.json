I understand that the intent of `vim.lsp.enable` is for it to be called once early during startup.\n\nHere's my use case: I have a noisy LSP ([harper-ls](https://writewithharper.com/docs/integrations/language-server)) that I like being able to turn off when it's distracting. I want to disable it for all current buffers and future buffers. I also want to be able to turn it back on, and not have to reload my buffers for it to start up.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCalling `vim.lsp.enable('harper_ls', true)` immediately enables the LSP for all current buffers, and any future buffers I open. Similarly, calling `vim.lsp.enable('harper_ls', false)` immediately disables the LSP for all current buffers, and it doesn't get started for future buffers that I open.",
