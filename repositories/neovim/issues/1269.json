Depending on what's hosting it and the configuration, root may not be allowed access (I've worked with several systems configured this way).  You're correct: the only way around this is to build in a local directory.  Another choice would be to not install it into a global location, but to a place you have write permissions instead.  For instance, ~/.local or ~/.local/neovim.\n",
