    "body": "# Intro\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion about this on gitter the other day, see https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim?at=5f07781c46c75b1e5e3524ff\r\n\r\nPresently, all insert mode completion is based on exact prefix matches. This works great when you have a small list of candidates but as soon as your list of candidates grows large, it becomes frustrating to narrow down. You have to either type the exact prefix yourself or navigate the huge list.\r\n\r\nI propose we add a new option `fuzzy` to `completeopt` that will enable fuzzy completion in all completion modes. i.e omnifunc, file completion and keyword completion would all become fuzzy. This would make it much simpler to narrow the completion list when it becomes large and is a standard feature found in nearly every other modern editor.\r\n\r\nI am *not* proposing this become default as we want to avoid surprising existing users.\r\n\r\n# Why can't this be implemented with a plugin?\r\n\r\nThe gitter link above discusses this in more detail but the problem is that plugins can only fetch the initial candidates fuzzily. As you type more characters, neovim narrows down the list of candidates itself instead of consulting whatever plugin is providing completions. Thus, as you type more characters, you have to provide the exact prefix to narrow down the list.\r\n\r\nIt may seem to work if you have autocomplete enabled in which case when the list is narrowed down to zero candidates, the plugin will repopulate the list with new candidates based on fuzzy matching but this results in awkward flickering. See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8184#issuecomment-377431559\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nWe discussed that the current matching implementation is written in C and so difficult to extend. To implement this feature, it may be a good idea to switch the matching implementation to lua first and then add a fuzzy completoept. I'm not 100% sure as it may be easier to write only the fuzzy matching implementation in lua or reuse https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8184/files which imports [fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you think this is best implemented.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to lead this feature so feel free to assign me. I probably won't get to it soon though so if anyone else would like to take it off my hands, please feel free.\r\n\r\ncc @Shougo @clason @fsouza",

I don't know how accessible the omnicomplete function is from within lua, but it seems to me a reasonable first step would be to allow injecting lua functions as candidate filters into omnicompletion. These could then be used to implement non-standard sorting and -- in particular fuzzy -- filtering. \r\n\r\nAs a second thought, it could be useful to have a generic (and highly tunable) fuzzy matching utility function in  lua, which could then be used by other plugins as well (such as completion-nvim, which already implements a basic version itself).\r\n\r\nAs a last point, I'd like to second @mfussenegger's comment that the LSP spec does not specify whether sorting, filtering, etc. is the job of the server or the client, so the behavior differs wildly between servers -- leading to problems if the client assumes differently... But the proposal is much more general than LSP completion, of course.",

Trying to come up with good fuzzy algorithm wasn't worth for me since some fuzzy algorithm might not make sense for certain language while makes sense for others. If you start implementing MRU it starts getting more complicated so I pushed it to userland.\r\n\r\nWhile not officially supported you can also create an async asyncomplete preprocessor. Here are few examples;\r\nhttps://github.com/machakann/asyncomplete-ezfilter.vim\r\nhttps://github.com/tsufeki/asyncomplete-fuzzy-match\r\n\r\nFew notable difference compared to other autocomplete plugins is that asyncomplete only takes a function that user can sort/match/filter instead of making it separate. argument to preprocessor takes `{ 'source_name': items}` which looks like `{ 'lsp': [item1, item2]}`, `{buffer: [item1, item2]}`. This allows the user to get the source options and sort it by priority and other improvements they want such as might be don't even show buffer if there are items from other sources.\r\n\r\n+1 `completefilterfunc` since it is very simple and powerful similar to asyncomplete. \r\n\r\nIn future it could support async but I'm hoping lua is fast enough that this wouldn't be a concern.\r\n\r\n```vim\r\nfunction! s:completfilterfunc(opt) abort\r\n   call timer_start(1000, {t->a:opt.complete([])})\r\nendfunction\r\n\r\nset completefilterfunc+=s:completefilterfunc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf use `+=` one could allow chaining.",
