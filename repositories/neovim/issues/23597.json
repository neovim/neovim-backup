With empty buffer I mean that the file is shown with no content in the previous buffer although the file does contain text.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim --clean\r\n:Explore\r\n* open some file with \"v\"> to create the \"previous buffer\"\r\n* go back to netrw browse the directory tree and try to open some files using the \"P\" shortcut\r\n\r\nIt seems to be more reproducible if you try to open files that reside in different directories.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nthe files should always open in the window created by the first \"v\" command.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.7.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, 9.0\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ngnome-terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nDebian",

But now, whenever I switch to another workspace and go back, the previously expanded directories in `netrw` are suddenly collapsed and I can't enter them anymore, instead a new `netrw` instance is opened in the main window. Also, when I toggle one of the parent directories by hitting `enter` twice, the files I was working on are listed again, but I still can't open them and get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError detected while processing function <SNR>44_NetrwBrowseChgDir:\r\nline  172:\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I tested all this without any configuration or plugins, on Linux Mint (Cinnamon).\r\n\r\nMaybe this should be a separate issue, but it feels like the same problem.
