The only reason I used help syntax was so that helptags would work.\n\nThat's a valid reason -- but are we actually using helptags right now?\n\n(After thinking about it, the situation is not as bad as I made it out; it may be possible to switch to using treesitter highlighting instead of legacy syntax while keeping the custom legacy syntax highlights and folds on top of it -- then we can add codeblock markers to the checkhealth output, same as for Markdown.)\n\nBut in general I agree that Markdown is the better \"base\" for the checkhealth output than vimdoc.\n\nHowever, no matter what the base syntax is, using treesitter highlighting/folding with custom additions is blocked by having buffer-local `set_query` support (which is a generally desirable feature).\n\n\n",
