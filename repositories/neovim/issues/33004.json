This is a symlink source which is then symlinked to `~/.config/nvim` as the destination.\n\nCurrently if you `nvim .` from within `~/dotfiles` and open any Lua file in `.config/nvim` (relative and still inside the dotfiles repo) with the LSP enabled, the `root_spec` gets changed to `~/.config/nvim` and now other tools that depend on this will think you're in `~/.config/nvim`.\n\nIt's like it's following a symlink source to the destination and using that as the new path when you're really still operating on local files in `~/dotfiles`. This is the part that feels like strange behavior since it's a source directory.\n\nIt's worth pointing out if you open a non-Lua file which has no LSP enabled in the same directory, then the issue does not occur.\n\n**Edit:** I recently came across `:LspInfo` after recording the video below. The Lua LSP shows the `root_directory` being modified to `~/dotfiles/.config/nvim/` but the BashLS LSP does not modify it, it remains at `~/dotfiles`. Perhaps that indicates the issue is specific to the Lua LSP and not Neovim itself?\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\nI really apologize. I don't know how to reproduce this with an isolated Lua example. I reported a similar issue to a specific plugin but they mentioned it's an issue with how the LSP itself is operating.\n\nI've recorded a video of it here (with audio):\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1920b172-e8dc-4972-ac05-00f3e3bb4611\n\nYou can also try it out on your own:\n\nYou can repeat this with my dotfiles at https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles, there's a section half way down in the readme file showing how to install them in a Docker container so you can try it out without polluting your system. A single install script will install everything and set up the symlinks.\n\nThen in the container you can:\n\n- `cd ~/dotfiles`\n- `nvim .`\n- Open `.config/nvim/lua/config/options.lua`\n- Hit `<leader>/` to open live grep\n- Search for `set-theme` and it won't show up (this file is in `.local/bin`).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe root path is not changed.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.4\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nLua 3.13.6 (obtained from `:LazyHealth`)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
