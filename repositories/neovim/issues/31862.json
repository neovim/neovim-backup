This could be done by either:\n\n- having them take a `String` instead of a `char *const` and use its `size` field;\n- adding a length parameter;\n\nExternal functions like `xstrdup` would need to be re-implemented.\n\nThoughts? I'm happy to work on this if there's interest.",

Based on the above PRs it seems that Vim is in favor of this kind of refactoring...",
