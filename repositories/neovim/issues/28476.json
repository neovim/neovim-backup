One downside of doing it universally is that if an LSP buffer is _not_ attached, and there are no valid tags files, then we lose the builtin `gd` behavior (which is, frankly, not very good, but some people may rely on it).\r\n\r\nNote that we do not simply map `gd` to `vim.lsp.buf.definition()` by default because using `'tagfunc'` provides a lot of other useful functionality (opening a definition in a split, searching for identifiers with `:ts`, etc.).\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** This is really only useful if mapping `gd` to `<C-]>` also gets us `<C-W>gd` \"for free\", which I'm not sure if it does.",
