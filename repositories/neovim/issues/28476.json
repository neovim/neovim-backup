    "body": "The default mapping for \"jump to tag\" is `<C-]>`, but this is awkward or difficult to type on some keyboards.\r\n\r\nNvim's LSP client sets `tagfunc` by default which enables jumping to a definition with `<C-]>`. `gd` is a very popular custom mapping for jumping to a definition, so mapping `gd` to `<C-]>` would essentially provide that mapping for free.\r\n\r\nWe could either do this universally, or only when an LSP buffer is attached. One downside of doing it universally is that if an LSP buffer is _not_ attached, and there are no valid tags files, then we lose the builtin `gd` behavior (which is, frankly, not very good, but some people may rely on it).\r\n\r\nNote that we do not simply map `gd` to `vim.lsp.buf.definition()` by default because using `'tagfunc'` provides a lot of other useful functionality (opening a definition in a split, searching for identifiers with `:ts`, etc.).\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** This is really only useful if mapping `gd` to `<C-]>` also gets us `<C-W>gd` \"for free\", which I'm not sure if it does.",
