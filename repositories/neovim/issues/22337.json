If there are buffers without a file name or\r\n\t\twhich cannot be written for another reason, Vim will not quit.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat seems unnecessary to me is the `Vim will not quit`. Why can't Vim `confirm` if you're okay trashing the buffer so that you can still make it to your end goal of exiting vim.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`:x` / `:xall` in the presence of modified no name buffers confirms if you are okay to lose your work",
