In this case, we're certain we want to prevent a callback from occurring, but the language server doesn't \"play nicely\" and [acknowledge cancellation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/03d15d9e098d75ddb6962aa9b27c2218e370a3b9/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua#L538)  after `client.cancel_request(req_id)`, which [is needed to `nil` the callback](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/03d15d9e098d75ddb6962aa9b27c2218e370a3b9/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua#L552).\r\n\r\nIt would seem convenient to expose the `message_callbacks` list from `rpc.lua` via a method like `client.set_request_callback(req_id, callback)`, which would make it possible to not only `nil` the callback, but more generally reset it to a new one, after the request has been made.\r\n\r\nIs there a specific reason why these callbacks were hidden entirely? Or is there already some workaround I'm unaware of? ",
