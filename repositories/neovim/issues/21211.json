So for it to be a Lua implementation, it would have to make copies of the data for Lua, run Lua code, jump back to C, parse the results from Lua and continue on with the rest of C implementation. Lua also has to be somehow instructed from C on what exactly should be parsed. I don't think it's particularly simplifying anything.\r\n\r\nThough to be fair, in context of `:trust` command, I think this could as well be done entirely in Lua, since most of the implementation is in Lua anyway. The module would just need a private lua function for `ex_trust` to run. I think I might've even suggested something like that?\r\n\r\nBut overall, there could be some utility function for `ex_*` functions to serialize `exarg_T` and forward it to Lua in one go, for commands entirely implemented in Lua. (Probably code from `nvim_create_user_command` can be reused.) I'm not sure it's really that important right now though, as I think `:trust` is the only command that's implemented in Lua?",
