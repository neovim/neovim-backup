However, it seems that sometimes when command (1) is slow, command (2) is also slow. On the other hand, it seems that command (3) is always fast.\r\n\r\nThis issue also seems to affect try-catch blocks.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- `nvim --version`: version 0.4.4\r\n- `vim -u DEFAULTS` (version: 8.2.1522) behaves the same; see the corresponding vim [issue](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/7320).\r\n- Operating system/version: NixOS 20.09\r\n- Terminal name/version: st version 0.8.4\r\n- `$TERM`: st-256color\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\n\r\n- Run `nvim -u NORC`.\r\n- Create a large file by typing `iecho 'test'<ret><esc>999.`.\r\n- Run command (1) above, `:syntax sync fromstart`. (Don't skip this step; at least on my system, skipping this step causes the error to not be reproduced.)\r\n- Run command (2) above, `:if 0 | syntax sync fromstart | endif`.\r\n\r\nThe command should execute instantaneously (like command (3) does), but does not.",
