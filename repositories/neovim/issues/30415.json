I can not remove the `[Process exited]` text from the buffer\r\n2. the buffer contains extra empty lines to fill the window\r\n\r\nI re-implemented the logic of the old [AnsiEsc.vim](http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#ANSIESC) plugin in nvimpager. The code is here https://github.com/lucc/nvimpager/blob/main/lua/nvimpager/ansi2highlight.lua\r\nIt is a state machine that walks over the buffer text and dynamically creates highlight groups and applies them to the relevant parts of the buffer. If the decision is to implement something like this in neovim I can send a PR or help people implement it. (AnsiEsc.vim uses regexes to define a fixed list of highlight groups up front whereas nvimpager parses the buffer with a custom state machine and only creates the required highlight groups on the fly and applies them by buffer position)\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not investigate if treesitter can be used to parse ansi escape sequences.
