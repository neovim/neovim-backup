Though, I do see having an option per each of these to be less customisable opposed to allowing providing a callback that formats the diagnostics in a preferred way.\n\nOne caveat with a callback is with todays ergonomics it is a more complex task as users would either need to inline it in the statusline (most awkward) or make a global function like `_G.my_diagnostic_status = fun()` and to use it in their statusline.\n\nIMHO an ergonomic way is to set it in the vim.diagnostic.config if it's an option.",

            "body": "After giving this some thought I am not clear on the best path to proceed here. We have 3 mentioned paths forward\n\n1. **Format callback `vim.diagnostic.status(..., fmt: fun())`**: This would be the most flexible solution, allowing users full control over the output. As highlighted above, today the economics of passing a callback in a statusline expression are not great, though we can also allow setting this in `diagnostic.config`. I can see this being useful for cases where users are happy with the default statusline and want to slightly tweak the format. For anything too advanced it might be easier to write a custom function and bypass `diagnostic.status` entirely as `diagnostic.status()` becomes a wrapper around a user-provided function passing it `diagnostic.count(0)`. For this reason I am hesitant to suggest this approach.\n2. **Format options `vim.diagnostic.status(..., format: { ... })`**: This is least flexible and most opinionated, allows user to provide a minimal set of options. Which can include selecting diagnostic level to display, setting statusline specific characters, etc.\n3. **Introducing a new statusline item for each diagnostic level**: Proposed by @mfussenegger . This feels like a more ergonomic and native to statusline format. If we decide to go with this option, the statusline expression for diagnostics can look similar to `\"E:%de W:%dw I:%di H:%dh\"` where `%de` is diagnostic error count and so on. I do not mind what the exact names we can settle. This option solves the problem for users to select which kind of diagnostics they want to display. I can see it often require to use item groups `%(E:%de %)` for spacing and then highlights.\n\nMaking a choice here comes down to what exactly do we want as we have the based use case covered already with either `diagnostic.status()` or if we decide to move to statusline items. I guess the choice comes to\n* we want to make the common things easy and for others its to the user (option 2)\n* \"bring your own complexity\" for any customisation i.e. any customisation is on user (option 1 or 3)\n\nInterested to see what others think about this",
