This could also be expanded to set options in `vim.diagnostic.config`. Though, I do see having an option per each of these to be less customisable opposed to allowing providing a callback that formats the diagnostics in a preferred way.\n\nOne caveat with a callback is with todays ergonomics it is a more complex task as users would either need to inline it in the statusline (most awkward) or make a global function like `_G.my_diagnostic_status = fun()` and to use it in their statusline.\n\nIMHO an ergonomic way is to set it in the vim.diagnostic.config if it's an option.",
