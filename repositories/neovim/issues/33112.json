I know the current behavior is intended (cycling through either usual or help buffers), but it doesn't seem considered carefully enough.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nQuite trivial. It's a documented behavior.\n1) Open a few files\n2) Open a few help pages\n3) Thy to cycle throughout all the buffers with `:bn`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe cycling with `:bn` / `:bp` should work throughout all of the listed buffers.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, AFAIK vim behaves differently\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDoesn't matter\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nDoesn't matter\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nDoesn't matter\n\n### Installation\n\nDoesn't matter",
