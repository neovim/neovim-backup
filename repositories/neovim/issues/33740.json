Some of these start to fall under certain categories - some related to LSP, some related to window/pane control, some related to editing/mutating text in the buffer, and i would imagine more later. It would be nice if they are categorized such that it is easier to enable certain groups of them, when leaving others untouched - i.e `disable all LSP related mappings`, but `leave the text editing related ones` such as `gc`. It might be a good idea to also have a mapping be categorized by multiple categories, that way we will have more fine grained control. For example:\n`gc` - is under categories - default, text-editing\n`grc` - is under categories - deafult, lsp\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWe should be able to turn off the defautls, in a more structured way, rather than having to scout the docs, or the source code to see which are the new ones, for which modes they are bound, and manually collect a list of them and do a vim.keymap.del, for each keymap.\n\n**The main issue is that you have to do that process on each release, if they are under a given category, having disabled the category, adding new maps to a category in the future would automatically disable them**",
