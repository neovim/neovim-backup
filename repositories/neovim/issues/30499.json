In the case of 2, 1 would be in the column to the left of the number, and the second would take the place of the number. In the case of 1, it would go in the spot to the left of the number (or it could take the place of the number, I don't really care much).\r\n\r\nThe problem currently is that if I want to conserve space by using `signcolumn=number`, I'm limited to seeing only 1 sign. I'm ok with having one additional column for signs, but currently if I want to be able to see 2 signs I need 3 column, 2 for signs and one for number. I'd like to accomplish this with 2 (by reusing the number column).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI can set `signcolumn=number:1`, which will give 2 columns for signs, the number column plus one additional.",
