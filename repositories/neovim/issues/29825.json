I realize that I could break the line to edit the text and then rejoin it.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem right to have to edit text that you can't see because virtual text is obscuring the contents.  Yes, I realize that I don't have to use aligned virtual text, but if there is no way to push it out or temporarily hide the virtual text so that I can see or edit the real text, this mode is not as desirable as it otherwise would be.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd like for the virtual text to be aligned for most lines, but I don't want the actual text to be obscured when one line is too long.  Is there a way to get the following?\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo text                         # virtual stuff\r\nbar                              # more blah\r\nmore text here                   # text here tt\r\nreally long text that exceeds column  # more text\r\n```\r\n\r\n@ColinKennedy asked about this [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16545#issuecomment-1501355259).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to hide virtual text or push it to the right when the cursor is over that line?",
