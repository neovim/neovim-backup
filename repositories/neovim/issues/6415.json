    "body": "What I'm about to propose is going to break a lot of people's muscle memory and it's going to attract a lot of controversy, but please hear me out on this. This is a real chance to make things better for new users.\r\n\r\n## Getting into character\r\n### _a cursor on character vs in between two characters_\r\n\r\nNew users will often say that editing in vim is full of spurious off-by-ones, out of ignorance that the cursor may be on a character or between two characters. This cursor behaviour is maintained partly for historic but mostly for dogmatic reasons. Vim is dogmatic. Right. Tell you something you don't know. But this is different... Right? Well... The dogma goes that the cursor may be on a character or between two characters, and sometimes one make sense and sometimes the other makes sense. The reality, every new user will tell you, is that this is total bullshit, and with the sole exception of overwrite/REPLACE/R mode, a cursor between characters is the only thing that ever ever ever makes sense. It's painfully obvious the only reason this dogma ever arose in the first place was that old terminals couldn't render a cursor in between characters. For about four years, I thought the dogma was true, but then one day, I started looking for real situations where the distinction is useful, and six years later, I still have nothing. I then looked back on the confusion, frustration and hatred spawned by these apparently intentional off-by-one errors during my vim learning process, and came to the inescapable conclusion that there is a better way of doing things.\r\n\r\n## A game without character classes\r\nMy solution is one option that would allow the user to choose between legacy mode and a new mode that I'm going to call off-by-none mode. This switch will change several editing controls and behaviours. Please bear in mind I do not want this to be default behaviour, at least not until after off-by-none mode has undergone lengthy testing. I also understand that we'll probably always have legacy mode.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to go into enormous detail over rationale behind each change because the rationale for the changes is the same every time. The cursor is always between two characters in off-by-none mode. In a terminal, the two characters the cursor is in between are exactly the characters everybody expects the cursor to be between: the character the block is rendered on top of and the character to its left. I will not explain why these are so much better. That's why I'm asking you do this before reading the list:\r\n\r\n_Do an honest appraisal of all of the common editing patterns that come up regularly in your work and write them all down, along with the vi commands needed to make these happen. Do this, perhaps over a day's work, keeping a frequency count. Revisit these patterns in off-by-none mode. If you do, you will see the advantages, or at least you will see equivalent efficiency._\r\n\r\n_Think honestly about your learning experience with vim and what problems you had while learning. How much easier would it have been if you had learned off-by-none vim? Monitor the independent learning process of somebody learning vim for the first time. Where are they having difficulties? What parts of the editing process are causing problems? Would off-by-none fix those problems?_\r\n\r\nOK, let's begin.\r\n\r\n1. When you escape from an insertion, the cursor stays where it is, such that hitting i and not a effectively continues where the last insertion left off.\r\n\r\n1. e/E moves the cursor past the end of the word, so that i and not a starts inserting at the end of that word.\r\n\r\n1. $ moves the cursor past the last character on the line such that $i would have the same effect as A. (As a result of this, lines will need to be wrapped at 79 characters instead of 80 to leave space for a cursor which is not being rendered on an actual character, but vim already has troubles with lines exactly 80 characters long to the extent that in practice everybody I know formats to or under 79 characters anyway.)\r\n\r\n1. a appends to the end of a line instead of A. A is unmapped.\r\n\r\n1. When % moves to a closing delimiter, the cursor is placed after it.\r\n\r\n1. p pastes to the cursor's current location. P is unmapped. Wait, don't freak out! I haven't forgotten about line-wise pasting! See next change.\r\n\r\n1. All properly formatted text files end with a \\n. This will be rendered as an undeletable empty line at the end of every file, such that Gp pastes lines past the last unempty line in the file.\r\n\r\n1. When a length of text is highlighted in character-wise visual mode and the cursor is at the end, the character under the cursor is NOT in the highlighted text. In other words, if the cursor starts in the middle of the second word of a line of 8 words separated by whitespace, if you do bvWWWWd, this deletes four whitespace-separated words, leaving correct spaces around the remaining words:\r\n```\r\nbefore d:\r\nalpha beta gamma delta epsilon theta eta iota\r\n      _______________________________#\r\nafter d:\r\nalpha theta eta iota\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. s deletes a line and starts an insert instead of S. S is unmapped.\r\n\r\n1. When the cursor is between the last and second last characters of a word, hitting e/E does not skip the last character and move to the end of the next word. It instead move to the end of the current word. I'd consider this last rule to be implied, but this is one place where vi e/E behaviour just really messes with people's expectations.\r\n\r\n## And so forth\r\nThere is probably a lot more I'm forgetting, and some of what I proposed may not be a good idea after all, but the changes I have outlined give you the general idea. For now, just consider the spirit of the changes and what they could become. My own investigation into my vi usage patterns has taught me these changes do not subtract from usability, often improving it, and _dramatically_ improve learnability, making vi editing make a _lot_ more sense. Please, please, _please_ take these changes seriously, along with the problems they would solve for new users, and even for old users. Break from this piece of dogma that has haunted vim for so many years.\r\n\r\n## On a practical note\r\nHow hard would it actually be to enact these changes in neovim? I know it is completely impossible in vim for reasons everybody who has ever seen its code should be familiar with. I am a programmer after all, and if these changes are actually possible, I'd be happy to contribute to the development of off-by-none.",

Vim hides this character on non-empty lines.\nIn other editors, it is usually displayed as a space.\n\nConsequences of hiding it:\n\t•\tWhen leaving Insert mode, the cursor is forcibly moved one character to the left.\n\t•\tYou cannot treat this character with normal means; for example, x cannot delete it.\n\nLater remedies:\n\t•\tIt can be selected in Visual mode.\n\nEOB is not a character, but a position. When opening an empty buffer, the cursor is located at this position. Once Vim adds any character to the buffer, this position becomes hidden.\nIn other editors, it is usually displayed as a space.\n\nConsequences of hiding it:\n\t•\tIt is impossible to determine whether a buffer ends with an EOL.\n\t•\tSome APIs support this position while others do not, which causes confusion, for example #33935.\n\nThe second major design flaw is the ambiguity of the cursor position: is it between characters or on top of a character?\nHere, a cursor that is between characters is called a bar cursor, and a cursor that is on top of a character is called a block cursor.\n\nThe cursor position is important because it determines the selected region.\nIf it is a bar cursor, Vim calls it exclusive.\nIf it is a block cursor, Vim calls it inclusive.\n\nI believe the bar cursor is better than the block cursor, because a bar cursor can select an empty region, whereas a block cursor always selects at least one character.\nEmpty regions are useful—for example, with ci\". If a plugin wants to implement the c operator and there are no characters between the quotes, it could operate on an empty region. But currently this can only be done using hacks, because at least one character must be selected.\n\n(This is still true even when using set selection=exclusive.)\n\nAt present, the vast majority of motions and APIs are exclusive, which also shows that the bar cursor is superior.\nHowever, the current situation is that both cursor models are mixed together, which leads to confusion (the first flaw also plays a role here—for example, $ is inclusive entirely because EOL is hidden).\n\nSome hacks seem to solve the problem, such as preventing the cursor from moving when leaving Insert mode:\n\nset virtualedit=onemore\nset listchars+=eol:\\ ,\nautocmd InsertLeave * :normal! `^\n\nBut in my experience, the more such hacks are used, the more things break, because they are essentially fighting against everyone else’s assumptions and defaults.",
