If you hit 'K' on a identifier without a man page for example, you will only know that because the screen flickers and doesn't show the man page to you.\n\nThis patch basically is only to demonstrate that it is (easily?) possible to change the behavior. Further discussion is advised though. Making the behavior configurable would be an idea (I lean towards not interrupting the workflow with a pause and message in any case).\n",

Just using another shell is just as easy and is exactly equivalent (except that you may have to open a new shell or change to an open one).\n\nThis proposed behavior fits very well in my workflow so I am all for it. I can understand that other users have different requirements. That's why having the behavior configurable is probably the best approach.\n",

On the other hand, users who _don't_ want to see the results of a command have these options:\n- dispatch.vim\n- Neovim's `jobstart()`\n\nPerhaps we should think about adding a special async version of `:!` that uses `jobstart()`. Maybe one of these:\n\n```\n:>!\n:@!\n:&!\n```\n\nThe existing `>`, `@`, and `&` commands don't allow bang and probably never will.\n\n`:^` and `:)` are also available, although they might drive the VimL parser insane (not to mention VimL syntax highlighting).\n",

I know it is not perfect solution.  But it works and it is better than previous.\nI use `messagesopt` toggle for `:messages`.\n\n> Maybe it can truncate the message if neither hit-enter nor wait: is present?\n\nI considered implementing truncate support for messagesopt, but I couldn't see any advantages of enabling truncate, so I decided not to implement.\nI think it only makes sense when `wait:` is `0`, but if nothing is displayed on the screen, it doesn't matter whether truncate is enabled or not.",
