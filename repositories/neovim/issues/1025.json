            "body": "> Similarly, after playing back a macro I’d also expect the whole macro to be repeated\n\nYou mean you want to repeat macros with `.`? I dunno, many people find the distinction useful: If I replay a macro I don't want it clobbering my `.` repeat. But you could accomplish this fairly easily by something like this (from memory; not tested):\n\n```\nnnoremap @q :<c-u>call repeat#set(\"@q\")<cr>@q\n```\n\n> It’s a shame that something like https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat needs to exist.\n\nIt's probably reasonable for that to be baked-in somehow, but the plugin works so well that I don't see why that would be a high priority (am I missing something?). We can simply include vim-repeat plugin as part of Neovim's shipped defaults.\n\n> Could neovim possibly sometime in the future repeat the whole last command, instead of just the last part of it?\n\nDefine \"last command\".\n\nI've thought a lot about this myself, but it's not so simple to predictably extend the definition of an _atomic edit_ without breaking existing behavior that one perhaps takes for granted. I do, however, think there is room for a _new_ concept: something like a \"secondary repeat\", that is: \"repeat the last _atomic motion_\". Then that could be combined with the last \"atomic edit\" for a mega-repeat. \n\nFor example, let's say \"repeat last atomic motion\" is mapped to `<space>`. Then consider the following sequence:\n\n```\ndwi\n```\n\nHere the last atomic motion[1] is `dw` and the last atomic edit is `i`. To repeat the motion, one would press `<space>`. To repeat the motion _and_ the edit, press `<space>.`. Thereafter, `.` repeats the entire thing. \n\nThis might be half-baked, I haven't actually made a prototype or anything. But the key point is that I think we could gain a lot more by thinking about a new, lightweight way of composing motions with edits, rather than just overloading `.` with more cases.\n\n[1] **edit:** I was super tired when I wrote this; `dw` is of course not a \"motion\" :)\n",

This means repeating the entire last action that the user actively performed, no matter how many commands it  actually runs behind the scenes. This would improve behaviour in the \"dwi\" case, and also would allow . repeat to automatically \"do the right thing\" with plugin and function invocation.\n\nPerhaps the idea of an \"atomic\" command could be adapted to mean last \"entire executed command mapping\" for both . repeat AND undo states. Under this model, if we assume `nnoremap cw dwi` is set, then using cw would allow proper . repeat AND a `u` undoes the whole thing, whereas entering dwi manually would count as two actions, `dw` and `i`, therefore `.`  or `u` only affect the last `i`.\n\nSomething to think about.\n",

I have even started to learn to remember not to type that way when I know in advance that I want to repeat my edit!\n\n(I use a non-standard keyboard where the arrow keys are very convenient to reach, so the use of `<left>` is no problem to me.)\n",

For example, I don't want `.` to repeat my last `:NerdTree` command, or repeat my mappings for `:w` or `:bd`. We'd need a way to explicitly opt in for mapped batch repeat.\n\nHere's are two ideas:\n\n``` vim\n\" Option 1: Overload [v,n...](nore)map with a three argument version to explicitly opt in:\nnnoremap repeat cw dwi\n\" or\nnnoremap . cw dwi\n\n\" Option 2: perhaps add a new mapping keyword 'rmap'\n\" ('r' for 'repeat' though it should cause 'undo' to act on the full mapping as well)\nrnnoremap cw dwi\n```\n\nI like the three argument syntax, but this would break lots of plugins and existing mappings since vim treats everything after the second space as part of the mapping. \n\nI recommend the rmap keyword option because it clearly distinguishes that this is new behaviour, and will actually throw an error in vim rather than just silently doing wonky stuff. It also maintains complete back compatibility with plugins, but allows users to opt-in for their own mappings. \n\nOne could even do things like `rnoremap @@ @@` to make `@@` dot-repeatable, though honestly I'd prefer if the @ macro commands were all just made dot-repeated (and undoable) by default.\n\nUsing the rmap also provides the best compatibility (and least work) for plugin maintainers. If their plugin defines mappings they can use a block along the lines of:\n\n``` vim\nif has('nvim')\n    rnnoremap cw dwi\nelse\n    nnoremap cw dwi\nendif \n```\n\nOR they can just expose `<Plug>` mappings for the user to explicitly remap using rmap or map however they prefer.\n",

Now since the nature of these desires clearly differ quite a lot depending on the user, we have some insight into why vanilla vim's dot never became more powerful, and this is why we are where we are with it. \n\nI would advocate against changing the behavior (however slight) unless there is a configurable option to at least bring exact old behavior back. It would be a bit of a faux pas to implement a plugin that depended on `.` behavior, but I already have a binding I use a lot in my vimrc that does exactly that! (It calls `:normal! .j` or `:normal! .n` depending on `v:hlsearch`)\n\nThat being said, lumping arrow key movements into the dot action would simply be unmitigated _awesome_, and i couldn't argue against that.\n\nI really like the connection that has been made to the undo-tree actions, and also I have noticed that many clever plugins are able to do a thing called \"undo gluing\" where arbitrary sequences can be \"told\" somehow (I'm not familiar with the guts of how this is done) to all get undone with one `u`. One example of this is the really cool plugin https://github.com/t9md/vim-textmanip.\n\nMy suggestions are\n- Not to necessarily go all the way and just _replace_ `.` with \"repeat what `u` would undo\", make \"repeat what `u` would undo\" as a new, more flexible repetition command that users have the choice of mapping to `.`\n- Whether done with `.` or the concept of the \"last undo item\", **track the changes in a stack going backward**. This will allow full manipulation power parity with macros while eliminating the crucial barrier to entry of macros in that you have to explicitly mark the location where your macro starts. I don't care what kind of kludgy interface I have to wade through to re-construct the start point of my macro, I want to not have to explicitly mark it out, or resort to awful techniques like dumping a register containing a macro into the buffer in order to edit it in order to get the macro to do the right thing.\n\nFor me at least, constructing macros takes **at minimum** the amount of time it takes to just execute the task 5 to 10 times. So I can only realistically justify macrobuilding if I know a job has to be repeated 20 or more times (while it might take slightly longer to do it 15x, the cognitive load is much lower).\n",
