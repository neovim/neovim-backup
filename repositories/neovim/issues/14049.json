Can't use a different approach really because the plugin is just an extension to the vim-dadbod plugin which owns the `system()` invocation logic. And the program being called in `system()` doesn't support the common convention to treat `-` as stdin.\r\n\r\nI see these specific issues with Neovim here:\r\n\r\n* Discrepancy between `:!` and `system()` – for example `:!cat /dev/stdin <<<1` works as expected in the same environemnt\r\n* Also I've just realized that `:echo system('cat /dev/stdin <<<1')` works too – this makes me wonder even more of what is the internal logic of `system()` in Neovim\r\n* Documentation for `system()` clearly says that `'shell'` is used internally so I would expect `/dev/stdin` to work because it is indeed supported by my 'shell' (most shells apparently emulate /dev/stdin when it is missing)",
