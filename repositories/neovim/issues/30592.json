The configuration is scattered across different plugins and different places, and you have to piece them together manually. While some might consider this is \"decentralized\", I believe the basic, core LSP functionalities should be centralized in one place, or even built-in. Or at least a recommend config should be given out to contain all the features. Now there is just no such recommanded config. People just spend tons of time reading blogs, ask chatgpts, readiing plugin readmes.\r\n\r\nLSP is a complex and highly coupled  thing, it will consume the users too much time improve the default behaviour.",

It's actually very usable when paired with https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired (which has some mappings we should include in Nvim by default).\r\n\r\nStarting with the assumption that the UI needs to match coc.nvim or vscode is a fallacy. There are many parts of vim such as quickfix which have tons of features, but require some investment. That is the general theme of vim in general, and if you don't think it's useful then there is no point in using vim. (Note that this is 100% orthogonal to monotonic improvements, i.e. improvements that can be made to Nvim defaults or features without throwing away the useful parts)",
