    "body": "### Problem\n\n#37910 maps any LSP method without a server capability to a dummy capability with the same name as the method.\n\n`vim.lsp.buf_request()` checks if the client supports the method before sending the request, but any server following the LSP spec will not have a capability called \"callHierarchy/incomingCalls\", because the spec says the capability used to indicate support is \"textDocument/callHierarchy\". Thus, it will claim the method is unsupported and not send the request. Previously \"callHierarchy/incomingCalls\" was not in the capability map so the support check would return true.\n\nI have an upstream fix at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/pull/1720 that was intended to resolve #37696, but it would also resolve this issue. However, I don't think the metamodel would get updated until a new LSP version is released. This would be broken in the meantime.\n\nNote: `vim.lsp.buf.incoming_calls()` still works because it calls `client:request(\"callHierarchy/incomingCalls\")` which does not check server capabilities first.\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim --clean -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\nOpen a file and attach any server that supports call hierarchies, like clangd or emmylua_ls, and run the following.\n\n`:=vim.lsp.get_client_by_id(1):supports_method('callHierarchy/incomingCalls')`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`vim.lsp.buf_request_sync(0, \"callHierarchy/incomingCalls\")` should succeed if the server supports \"textDocument/callHierarchy\".\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-2404+gd9d8c660fd\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nn/a\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nn/a\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
