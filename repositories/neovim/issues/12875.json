As the documentation says, cleanadd.vim just loops\nthrough all add files and removes the ones that got commented by `zw`.\n\nAn argument could be made that this is a pointless optimization---it's\nnot like having a lot of comments in .add files will cause an OOM---but\nthe script is only a few lines anyway.\n",
