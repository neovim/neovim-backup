    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI'd like to replicate the full state of a terminal buffer so that the terminal can be restored from a Vim Session.vim file via `nvim -S Session.vim` later on. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe types of data to consider for this are\r\n\r\n- environment variables\r\n- `cd` (which is often simply a function of `$PWD`)\r\n- sub-shells\r\n- virtual environments (sub-shell or not). e.g. Python virtualenv.\r\n- terminal buffer variables. It seems plugins like [toggleterm.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim) don't fully restore, though that might be my user error\r\n\r\nRegarding sub-shells and virtual environments, I'd imagine both would require plugins to manage the specific details. But some sort of API to store list-of-commands so that interested plugins can add what they need that write to Session.vim and a means to load that data back would prevent needing to build one monolithic command that every plugin / tool has to play nice under. \r\n\r\nIn general it'd be a great improvement to get even one of these things though I have a feeling though most of this won't be possible because (if I remember correctly) Neovim isn't able to query that much from a started terminal such as environment variables. Is this request a pie in the sky? What do you think?",
