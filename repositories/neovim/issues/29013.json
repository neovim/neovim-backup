    "body": "### Problem\n\nI realise that there are already quite a few issues on here about the new default colorscheme, some of which touch on the surprising behaviour of `hi clear` in version 0.10. However, I'm opening this to discuss a specific set of surprises that I encountered, as a colorscheme maintainer, after upgrading to 0.10, and my suggestions for remedial changes. I am sympathetic to the desire for a new default colorscheme and appreciate the efforts being done here, but feel that there is at least a mismatch between the documentation and the current behaviour.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to v0.10, I had to add the following links to my colorscheme, to restore the intended look:\r\n- `hi! link Added DiffAdd`\r\n- `hi! link Changed DiffChanged`\r\n- `hi! link Delimiter Special`\r\n- `hi! link Operator Statement`\r\n- `hi! link Removed DiffDelete`\r\n- `hi! link @variable Identifier`\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that my colorscheme uses the common defensive initialisation technique of setting `hi clear` before defining its own highlights. Because this sets the highlights back to their defaults, I am expecting that those defaults follow `:h group-name`. However, after 0.10, the above groups were not linked to basic groups from `:h group-name`, and instead had distinct RGB settings. My questions are:\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- Why is `Added` not linked to `DiffAdd`? Is there any value in having these as distinct RGB definitions? Can the new default theme not simply set `DiffAdd` highlights?\r\n- Ditto, but for `Changed` and `Removed`\r\n- If it is really necessary to have `Delimiter` and `Operator` as distinct highlights by default, this change should be reflected in `:h group-name`, with those names being singled out instead of nested under `Special` and `Statement` by default\r\n- **Most surprisingly, why is `@variable` not linked to e.g. `Identifier`?** This change in particular means that any colorscheme which sets `hi clear` and fails to set a `@variable` highlight (which is again not documented in `:h group-name`) will inherit the default colorscheme RGB value for large portions of any treesitter-highlighted code\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, I'm unclear if the goal is to completely overhalul `group-name`, or if support for Vim8 themes is still intended. In any case, it would be good to document which group names a colorscheme maintainer must, at minimum, define after `hi clear`.",

In fact, `:h group-name` explicitly mentions that the grouping of highlight groups implies the default link:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe names marked with * are the preferred groups; the others are minor groups.\r\nFor the preferred groups, the \"syntax.vim\" file contains default highlighting.\r\nThe minor groups are linked to the preferred groups, so they get the same\r\nhighlighting.

I can understand the reason for the new `Added`, `Changed`, and `Removed` now.\r\n\r\n> _no_ group name is marked with `*` in that list\r\n\r\nYes, I see that there is no asterisk, but as was pointed out above, this was silently removed at some point due to a rendering issue. I assumed that the classification of groups had remained the same, based on the visual grouping in `:h group-name`. I stand corrected.\r\n\r\nAdding NeoVim-only highlight groups was already necessary, that is true, but the listings at `:h diagnostic-highlights` and `:h lsp-highlight` makes these trivial to support. Actually, the LSP ones link to standard group-names by default. My main gripe is with the silent promotion of tree-sitter highlight groups to a \"default\" level, such that colorscheme maintainers now have to add definitions for yet another list of symbols (which I just found at `:h treesitter-highlight-groups`), or have the most basic semantics of their colorschemes break.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm getting the message that this is unavoidable, so I will distill the essence of my complaints in that case:\r\n- Treesitter is called \"experimental\" in `:h treesitter`, which makes it surprising to me that treesitter highlights are now essential for NeoVim 0.10 colorschemes\r\n- Turning `hi clear`, which is common practice, into a landmine felt a little brutal and was not really signposted IMO; I could like a note at `:h :hi-clear` that mentions where to find the default definitions that will be used (which requires that these be defined in a predictable place)\r\n- The list of required highlight groups for a minimal colorscheme has now expanded at least 2x compared to Vim8, and the relevant symbols are not trivially discoverable (they are split among at least the above 3 locations in the helpfiles)",
