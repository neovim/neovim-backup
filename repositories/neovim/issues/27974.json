In my case, the jumplist contains references to files like X:\\dev\\xyz.txt, where drive X: is mapped to a network share that is unavailable some of the time.

',rX:/'              \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting `:ju` shows a jumplist with any items beginning `\\\\machine\\share`, `X:\\` and `X:/` permanently removed. So the only jumplist items remaining were on the local drive, all network locations' jumplist items were removed. By the way the last one `X:/path/to/file.txt' did appear on a few list items for some reason.\r\n\r\nJumplist items matching the above were permanently removed, so even removing the above from `init.lua` didn't bring them back.\r\n\r\nHowever doing the above fixed the long freeze when issuing the initial `:ju` or `<Ctrl-O>` command.\r\n\r\nThis does appear to work around the problem but doesn't appear to be an ideal fix:\r\n- there might be other network or temporary locations added to the jumplist during an editing session, so we'd have to keep adding more of the above commands to remove them\r\n- removal isn't ideal anyway, it's preferable to keep all jumplist items and just ignore them if files/paths (and drives in Windows) are inaccessible. Since the freeze only happens once, and everything works fine thereafter, is there a better way to fix?\r\n\r\nAppreciate the help, issue and workaround identified 🙂\r\n",
