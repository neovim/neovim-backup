    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI have two related problems:\r\n1. When using `:!` or `:term`, completion functions in a shell-like mode. The first argument is completed as `shellcmd`, while subsequent arguments are treated as `file`s. This behavior is not easily replicated with other commands. In attempting to resolve this issue, I discovered [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5685005/shell-command-completion) and [this plugin](https://github.com/ej-shafran/compile-mode.nvim/blob/main/plugin/command.lua#L9). Both solutions employ `completion=custom` and utilize some hacky methods to achieve shell-like completion. However, `completion=custom` may not integrate well with plugins like wilder.nvim.\r\n2. There is no effective methods to retrieve the current completion pattern. As a result, completion plugins like wilder.nvim  do the heavy lifting by itself and parses the command line independently, which seems unnecessary since Neovim already does that internally.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n1. It seems reasonable to be able to enable this shell-like completion on user commands with `shellcmd` completion type.\r\n2. Add new function to the family of functions `getcmd*` to expose current completion pattern.\r\n\r\nI already hacked on that matter a bit in this [PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/30698). This is just a proof of concept so no docs or additional tests added.\r\nThat is my first contribution attempt and I just wanted to be sure that such a change could possibly go upstream. If that is the case I'm gonna add docs and tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure if this should be one or two issues/PRs but the PR is small enough and I worked on them in pair so I decided to submit it as one.",
