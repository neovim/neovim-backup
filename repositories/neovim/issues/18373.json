Modify `test/busted/outputHandlers/nvim.lua` so that:\r\n    1. when running in CI, it writes the full logs (as today) to a known location\r\n        1. make the full log available as a GHA artifact.\r\n    1. when running in CI, it writes _minimal_ logs to stdout\r\n        1. omits _successful_ tests\r\n        1. prints a dot (.) every few tests (to avoid \"hang\" detection in CI)\r\n1. Modify `src/nvim/testdir/runnvim.sh` in a similar way (or pipe it through the same filter as `test/busted/outputHandlers/nvim.lua`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## See also\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11009 will reduce the \"server failed to start\" spam in the logs\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8519",
