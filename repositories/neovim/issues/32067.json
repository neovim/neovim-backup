Open `nvim -u NONE` in iTerm2.\n2. Resize the terminal window.\n3. Visual artifacts appear (see attached video)\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eebc6709-4c44-4ae4-9e7b-d008d7429671\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo visual artifacts.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.0 commit ge41368f3bc (and above)\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.1.754\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niTerm2 3.5.11\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",
