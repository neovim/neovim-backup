Some notes:\n\n- I do not think we should limit this to tree-sitter groups. `:h treesitter-highlight-groups` mentions that all treesitter captures are directly usable as highlight groups; i think we should allow this for any highlight group, which includes `Syntax` files and LSP highlighting.\n- Threre are multiple types of search in nvim. The ones I found were:\n  - `:s`, as mentioned. the issue mentions using `@` to delimit, but if we allow non-treesitter captures we need some other character. i like `:s/{search}/{replace}/[flags][:group] [count]`, where `:group` must follow the flags. but i could be convinced of some other syntax.\n  - `:&`. basically the same as `:s`, i don't foresee problems here.\n  - `/` and `?`. originally i thought this could use `/{pattern}/[offset][:group]`; but `offset` is allowed to be a full second search: `/{pattern}/;{subpattern}/`. and in that case tacking `:group` on the end makes it unclear whether it applies to the first or second.\n  - `:/` and `:?`. i don't see how to add a group here, because these are specified such that anything following the `:/{search}/` is an Ex command. maybe we could do something *before* the pattern that doesn't yet have a meaning, like `\\:` or `^`, so it ends up looking like `:[^group]/{pattern}`? and have that be a general `:h :range-pattern`, so it can be used for any command, not just these particular filters?\n  - `:g`, `:v`. same as `:/`, the syntax for these is specified very tightly and i don't think we can extend it. range patterns would work here too though.\n- implementation notes:\n  - you can get the id of a group with `syn_check_group`\n  - the code for `:s` lives in `do_sub`\n  - the actual code that does the searching is `vim_regexec_multi`. probably we want a wrapper around this that checks if the hit was in a highlight group or not and re-performs the search if so?\n  - to find the highlight group of a position in the file you can use `syn_get_id` in combination with `syn_get_stack_item`; see `f_synstack` for an example.",
