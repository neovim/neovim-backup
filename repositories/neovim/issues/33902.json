    "body": "### Problem\n\nI find it annoying that \"Tutor\" mode is always on (or debug mode is off)\neven when I open a file with :edit command. Which means I can not even edit and save a `.tutor` file by default, I have to run `let g:tutor_debug = 1` before opening the file\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI think it makes more sense to make Tutor mode:\n- Always on when it is opened with :Tutor command\n- Off otherwise\n\nFor reference, `:help` has much saner default behavior, I get `'readonly'`, `'nomodifiable'` when I open a help file with the `:help` command, but when I open it with `:edit`, I can still edit and save change to the help file as normal",
