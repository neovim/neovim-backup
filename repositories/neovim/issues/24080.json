Example:\r\n\r\n```fennel\r\n{1 :gbprod/cutlass.nvim\r\n :opts {:cut_key :x<Enter>\r\n        |\r\n        ^--- cursor is here\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it looks like `gg=G` does not indent correctly. So this is a shortcoming of Clojure's `indentexpr`.\r\n\r\nYou can try contacting the Clojure indent file's maintainer (listed in the file). They may be interested in improving it. Or even better, you can try and improve it yourself.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use an external tool like [`fnlfmt`](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/fnlfmt), or a plugin like [nvim-parinfer](https://github.com/gpanders/nvim-parinfer).\r\n",
