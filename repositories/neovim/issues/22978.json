    "body": "### Problem\n\nThere are two sides to this request:\r\n\r\n1.  I prefer using digraphs to encode Unicode characters over doing the same with an `imap`, etc.  However, that only works for Unicode where there's already a precomposed character, so trying to do `vim.fn.digraph_set('D^', 'D̂')` (for a spelling reform I'm trying out) doesn't work.  I can see the reasoning behind the limitation, but it still seems somewhat arbitrary, especially when I'm just trying to do something with combining characters rather than inserting a full word or even snippet.\r\n2.  I've gotten a bit too fast with this and have started inserting \"<C-'>.\" instead.  Trying to do `vim.fn.digraph_set(\"<C-'>.\", 'ʼ')` (Unicode apostrophe) *also* gave me an error about too many characters.  The reasoning behind this one is obvious and I definitely don't want to open the door to trigraphs, but it still feels like the length of the string should be calculated *after* chord replacement since `<C-d>` is ultimately little different than `D`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n1.  Setting a digraph for a combined character should succeed.  NVim (and even vim) already has knowledge of what's combined or not for things like `ga` so that shouldn't be an impossible distinction to make.  If y'all don't mind an even more obvious backwards-incompatibility I certainly wouldn't complain if the single-conceptual-character-output limitation was lifted entirely (snippets).\r\n2.  Using chord notation in the digraph input should succeed; `<C-k><C-'>^` should be just as valid a sequence as `<C-k><S-d>^`.\r\n\r\nI've worked around 2 by mapping a non-Ctrl-chord key to start digraphs -- which I should have done anyway given how often I use them -- but it still seems like opening digraphs up for a greater variety of chords would improve its perceived consistency.",
