I'm not sure what you meant about `termopen()`, but if I have four levels of NeoVim terminals, I can press `i` three times to get to the leaf instance, not six times.\n\nI'd see myself going up or down the tree of NeoVim instances more often than wanting to jump to the root, so, for example, here's what my strokes would look like (if this feature existed) to go up one level, over a tab, and back down:\n\n```\n<c-\\><c-n>gti\n```\n\nSuppose I'm 3 levels deep. Now, while I'm at this level, I might need to switch in and out of terminals related to the current project (perhaps a terminal for the code repository that I'm working in so I can run git commands). The keystrokes for that (the way it currently works) is\n\n```\n<c-\\><c-\\><c-\\><c-n>gti\n```\n\nI'm more likely to want to jump in and out of terminals at the current level (my current task) than I am to want to jump to the root. So, if I'm jumping around at level 3, each time I want to switch from a terminal to a text file I'll be doing a bunch of\n\n```\n<c-\\><c-\\><c-\\><c-n>gti\n<c-c>gti\n<c-\\><c-\\><c-\\><c-n>gti\n<c-c>gti\n```\n\nAnd not only that, I have to remember what level I'm in (more brain CPU) and always have to count how many `<c-\\>` strokes I input before being able to switch out of the current workspace's terminal.\n\nThat's _slow_.\n\nIt should be the other way around. For example, if I'm at level 15 (I doubt anyone will ever have that many levels unless they come up with a _really_ **really** good session saver) I shouldn't have to count 15 strokes of `<c-\\>` just to move around between a couple terminals. It should just be\n\n```\n<c-\\><c-n>gti\n<c-c>gti\n<c-\\><c-n>gti\n<c-c>gti\n```\n\nThen, if I really want to go back to the root, it could be\n\n```\n<c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n><c-\\><c-n>\n```\n\nor, better yet\n\n```\n15<c-\\><c-n>\n```\n\nor, if I'm unsure how many levels I have but it's less than 20,\n\n```\n20<c-\\><c-n>\n```\n\nand it stops at the root. That's a ton of keystrokes saved.\n\n> And I do not see what workflow you should be using to have something greater then `<C-\\><C-\\><C-n>`\n\n`<C-\\><C-\\><C-n>` is one stroke too many, even if I only have two levels.\n",
