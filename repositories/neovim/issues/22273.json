These directories are on the build machine, and should not leaked into the final build.\r\n\r\nThis is not a sever bug, but would be nice to be fixed in the make script.\r\n\r\nBy the way, both `package.path` and `package.cpath` use the current directory as the first search location. IMHO, it is okay for command-line lua/luajit, but should be removed from the luajit embedded in nvim.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim --clean\r\n:lua print(package.path)\r\n:lua print(package.cpath)\r\n:q\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nDirectories from the build machine are not included in the lua search path.\r\n\r\nAlso, the current directory should be removed from the search path as well.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.8.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nnot tested.\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian 11\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nurxvt\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nBoth build from repo, and install the neovim Debian build.",
