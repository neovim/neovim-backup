It looks like `'imactivatefunc'` and `'imstatusfunc'` fit that model, so I don't have a strong objection to restoring them. As long as it doesn't involve lots of platform-specific code or new build-time dependencies.\n\n> Vim implements `'imactivatefunc'` and `'imstatusfunc'` in `gui_xim.c`, even though these 2 options don't require Vim compiled with `+xim` or any GUI features at all [vim/vim#2349](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/2349)\n\n",
