It's in response to user actions each time (so there's a \"long\" delay in comparison to flashes of content, i.e. human timescale not machine timescale). \r\n\r\nI would argue that shifting each time is the correct behavior, as at each point what is on screen is a more \"correct\" snapshot of the \"state\" of the document. We don't worry about shifting when we reach the end of a line because it's what the user *expects* to happen (and would be surprised if it didn't), imho we should treat this the same way. ",
