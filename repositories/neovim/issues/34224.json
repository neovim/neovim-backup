I would like to not turn off the message of it being saved, but I also don't want to be disrupted by the more window being opened. It feels like another `PRESS Enter to continue`\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fec808a-286a-4214-8c18-41ff7dfe1dca\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\ninit.lua\n```lua\nrequire(\"vim._extui\").enable({ msg = { pos = \"box\" } })\n```\n\nCreate a file with a long filename, enable extui with pos = box, and save the file. The more window will open if it doesn't fit. This can happen quite a lot when I am using my laptop without an external screen, and for example have a split between my terminal and a browser\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect the more window to not open\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-458+gcc264d51ab\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.4.1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.34.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from source",

Instead, the goal is to have _semantic_ annotations for messages that allow them to be routed to the fitting outlet (instead of guessing based on output size). This means we need to distinguish\n1. explicit output (-> always to more window for inspection, searching, yanking)\n2. status messages as feedback to operations (success, error, warning, info -> routed to cmdarea or box, depending on `pos`)\n3. progress messages (-> routed to cmdarea or box, depending on `pos`, but in the latter case in a _fixed_ position_ so they overwrite; never added to `:messages`)\n\nIdeally, these message \"categories\" can be mapped from the existing message \"kinds\", although some heuristics may be necessary (for plugins with missing \"kinds\", for example). This would also centralize these routing decisions and make it easier to document and reason about them.",

I think we were quite set on automatically routing interactively typed \"inspection\" messages to the more window. Those shouldn't require an extra step (so would be opt-out if absolutely necessary, but I don't think it's harmful to open the more prompt for such messages).",
