    "body": "### Problem\n\nI implement a neovim plugin to help with japanese learning (a simpler https://rikaitan.github.io/ for neovim).\nOne thing I want to do is tokenize (split into different words since there are no space between the words, with something like https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/) japanese sentences  along the way. Thus I need to retreive the current sentence.\nWhile this seemed like an ideal usecase for treesitter, I have failed to find a grammar for prose or a lua api for that (I ma have missed something), one can use the textobject \"as\" though in japanese/asian it's a bit tricker since the final dot `.` is not but `。` (same problem with `！ / ？`), which is ignored by neovim.\n\nFor instance, with the cursor on first character, pressing `)` moves cursor to next line instead of stopping after `。`:\n```\nこのマークは、国くにのルールを守まもっているおもちゃにつけます。 3歳さいまでの子こどものおもちゃは、このマークがついていないと、売うることができません\n```\n\nI have started patching src/nvim/textobject.c to support `。`. I think it makes sense to support this natively but before I invest more time in a proper patch I wonder:\n- why this isn't already the case considering the big japanese vim community already ?\n- can this be considered a breaking change ? I doubt plugins rely on east-asian dots being ignored to select text. Even then, I would venture it's worth breaking\n- what about prose text-objects as tree-sitter-grammar since text-ojects can depend upon languages etc. More as a roadmap though, in a first step modifying src/nvim/textobject.c looks good enough\n\nrelated:\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8544\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22740\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1qim6dt/is_there_a_sentence_text_object_that_doesnt_stop/\n\n### Expected behavior\n\npressing `)` should take into account the ` ` final dot and use it to differentiate between  sentences .",
