    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim's default file explorer, netrw, is a legacy Vim script that feels disconnected from an otherwise modern, Lua-centric editor. Its interface and keybindings are often unintuitive and inconsistent with standard buffer workflows, creating a point of friction for both new and experienced users. This leads the vast majority of the community to immediately replace it, signalling that the default out-of-the-box experience is not meeting user expectations.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe default file explorer should be a modern, Lua-based tool that integrates seamlessly with Neovim's core principles. By replacing netrw with a solution like oil.nvim, file management would operate within a standard buffer. This would allow users to intuitively leverage all their existing muscle memory for navigation, editing, and plugin usage directly on the file system. The expected result is a cohesive, powerful, and \"Vim-like\" file management experience from the very first launch, without requiring immediate configuration to be usable.\n",
