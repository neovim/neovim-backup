Other paths are fine.\r\n\r\nsearch terms: backslash, question mark\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nPS> nvim \\\\?\\D:\\hello.txt\r\nE303: Unable to open swap file for \"\\\\?\\D:\\hello.txt\", recovery impossible\r\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe swap file is correctly read and written.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, 9.1. Vim simply does not recognise paths starting with `\\\\?\\` and opens as if it were called without a path.\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 10 22H2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nPowershell\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A\n\n### Installation\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-win64.msi",

Neovim \"recognize\" both, but doesn't know how to handle it.\r\n\r\nVim uses `opendevice` option to read and write this files, and apparently Neovim has this option on documentation but, as far as I found, doesn't use it on the code.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a matter of just patching the code related to `opendevice` option.",
