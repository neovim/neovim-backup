But glibc has strong backward compatibility using symbol versioning. It's not usually worth the trouble to build and link aginst musl if your distro uses glibc. What you should be worried about are all the other third-party libraries, which aren't often written to be statically linked--because of namespace pollution, because of slightly different semantics between dynamic and static code, especially at application startup.\r\n>\r\n> Fortunately, Linux supports packaging apps much like macOS bundles, where all shared objects are kept under a relocatable subtree. When building a binary that will be installed in bin/, for example, just use the following GCC flags:\r\n>\r\n>     -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../lib' -Wl,--enable-new-dtags\r\n> \r\n> The first flag tells the linker to find libraries in the lib/ directory adjacent to the binary file itself. The second flag tells the linker to try LD_LIBRARY_PATH first rather than the embedded rpath. Debugging and regression testing can be very difficult without the ability to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and unfortunately LD_LIBRARY_PATH has lower precedence than embedded rpaths, thus the need for --enable-new-dtags to change the default behavior.\r\n> Note that $ORIGIN is a special string that is expanded by the runtime linker, not by the shell at compile time. It's an unfortunate choice of syntax. Getting $ORIGIN to pass through to the compiler without being evaluated by a shell can be tricky when dealing with recursive make and shell invocations, such as from an RPM spec file.\r\nAnother example: when building a Lua module I'll use\r\n>\r\n>      -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../..' -Wl,--enable-new-dtags\r\n> \r\n> because Lua modules are usually installed under $(prefix)/lib/lua/5.?/, two directories below lib/.\r\n\r\n",
