The call hierarchy is a tree but the LSP results are currently dumped into the quickfix list, a flat list. To display the tree we really need to build a new bit of UI, which is a non-trivial undertaking\n\nI have written [a Telescope plugin](https://github.com/jmacadie/telescope-hierarchy.nvim) that does show the call hierarchy in a treeview. In the [See Also section](https://github.com/jmacadie/telescope-hierarchy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#see-also) I call out a number of alternatives that I found, if what I've written is not to your taste.\n\nI'd love to be wrong on this, but I suspect that for the above reasons this problem will be solved by plugins and not Neovim core.",
