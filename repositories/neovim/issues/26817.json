            "body": "I've been recently looking at this problem, as I too wanted a deeper call hierarchy and ended up here following a Google search.\n\nThe honest truth is it is a bit tricky for the following reasons:\n- The LSP only answers with the hierarchy one level deep, to explore the \"full hierarchy\" you need to make repeated calls on each subsequent layer\n- There is potentially exponential growth on the discovered hierarchy, if each function leads to multiple further functions, Recursive calls in particular would be infinite\n- You can limit this (to the number of functions in a codebase) by caching the found call hierarchy information for a function but this is extra hassle and is still potentially quite large on big codebases\n- Even when you do discover the whole hierarchy there is then the question of how to display it. The call hierarchy is a tree but the LSP results are currently dumped into the quickfix list, a flat list. To display the tree we really need to build a new bit of UI, which is a non-trivial undertaking\n\nI have written [a Telescope plugin](https://github.com/jmacadie/telescope-hierarchy.nvim) that does show the call hierarchy in a treeview. In the [See Also section](https://github.com/jmacadie/telescope-hierarchy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#see-also) I call out a number of alternatives that I found, if what I've written is not to your taste.\n\nI'd love to be wrong on this, but I suspect that for the above reasons this problem will be solved by plugins and not Neovim core.",
