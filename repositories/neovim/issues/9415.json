One example use-case would be `call neomake#configure#automake('nrwi', 500)` which is necessary to configure `neomake`. Currently it is hard to do that when `neomake` is an optional plugin.\r\n\r\nI imagine something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nautocmd PackLoaded neomake call neomake#configure#automake('nrwi', 500)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe autocommand should only be triggered on the first load. If there was also a `PrePackLoad` than it would be possible to chain `packadd`s, i.e. make sure dependencies are loaded before a plugin is loaded.\r\n\r\nThe natural place to call these autocommands seems to be here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/1e8d2bdc487cdebf152eb228ed936720cfed3a76/src/nvim/ex_cmds2.c#L2740",
