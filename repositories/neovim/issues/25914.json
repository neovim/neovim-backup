So presumably we're blocked until libuv offers an API.\r\n\r\n# Related\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/4179\r\n- https://github.com/catern/supervise (from the author of https://catern.com/process.html )\r\n  > Guaranteed termination of all the transitive children of a child process",
