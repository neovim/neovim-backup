Creating such file would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnvim -u NORC\r\ni foobar escape\r\n:%!gpg -c\r\n(normally here you type in and repeat the passphrase and then can save encrypted buffer)\r\n(in NVIM the buffer doesn't get encrypted and process freezes)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the time being I use Vim to do it but it would be nice to fully switch to NVIM.",
