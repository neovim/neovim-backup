This makes it really difficult to repair my config because I lose all my plugins while I'm editing my neovim configuration.\n\nIt would be really great if there was some setting that could suppress those errors from popping up.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA way to suppress the errors (write them to a file instead perhaps?) so I can use the existing config to repair the configuration.",

When I say \"lose all my plugins\" I mean not that the plugins aborted but that to circumvent all these very verbose errors, I will run neovim without any configuration to get a usable editor to fix my config with.\n\nIf these errors could be suppressed, then I could carry on fixing my config with the plugins that managed to be loaded.",
