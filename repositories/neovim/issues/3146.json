When the terminal ends, `~/bar` no longer has an alternate buffer.  I'm guessing that with `:term` being ephemeral, @antoyo thinks it shouldn't replace `~/foo`'s role as an alternate buffer to `~/bar`.\r\n\r\nAlso, `:keepalt terminal` doesn't work the way I thought it would.\r\n\r\n> Still trying to determine what \"fix\" means (see above).\r\n\r\nI think \"fix\" just means \"do something predictable\".  When I started using `:term` it was definitely annoying that closing a terminal took the window with it.  The most annoying part about it is that I created the window and I didn't like that something else stole it from me.\r\n\r\nWe could just restore the terminal's alternate buffer's original alternate buffer when closed when on the last window.  I think a better option is just leaving behind a normal `nofile` buffer with the terminal's text if `:term` without a command is used.  Let the user figure out what to do with it.  It's also nice to have the option of keeping it around for reference.\r\n\r\n@antoyo maybe this is a good workaround:\r\n\r\n```vim\r\nnnoremap <expr> <c-^> (empty(@#) ? ':bprev' : ':b#').\"\\<cr>\"\r\n```",
