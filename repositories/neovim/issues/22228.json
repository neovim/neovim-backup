    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nThe fact that incsearch allows ctrl-g and ctrl-t to cycle through different instances of the matched string before accepting the complete motion is awesome, particularly when used in operator-pending mode.  Say we have the following line and our cursor is at the beginning in normal mode:\r\n`blah blah blah`\r\nWe can use `c/blah<ctrl-g><ctrl-g><enter>` to change everything up to the third \"blah\" (exclusive).  But what if I wanted to include the third \"blah\" in the change?  It seems like I should be able to make use of the {offset} (:help /) to do `c/blah/e<ctrl-g><ctrl-g><enter>` ; however ctrl-g and ctrl-t do nothing as soon as you add the second slash to specify the offset.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nDesired behavior would be for ctrl-g and ctrl-t to still cycle through potential matches and once enter is pressed, any {offset} specified would be respected.  In the example above, our change would include the third \"blah\" (we would be in insert mode with nothing on the current line).",
