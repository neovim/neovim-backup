Additionally it should provide both \"raw\" name used for `:packadd nvim-lspconfig` (`nvim-lspconfig` here) and resolved full path of the plugin being added (like '/home/user/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/core/opt/nvim-lspconfig'). As part of `:h event-data`, but also maybe as `<amatch>`.\n\nI would also think that having `PackaAddPre` is relatively low effort, yet might be worth adding for users/plugins to act *before* a plugin is added.\n\n---\n\nThe `Source{Pre,Post}` events indeed don't look like a good fit here because there indeed might not be a file to source during `:packadd`. While side effects like changed 'runtimepath' still might be worth reacting to. Plus a dedicated `:packadd` related data doesn't quite fit here.\n\n---\n\nFor completeness, in relation to `vim.pack` there were [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/34770#issuecomment-3045313202) and [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/35270#issue-3306465023) comments about a dedicated `PackLoad[Pre]` events. TL;DR: it might be worthwhile, but with `PackAdd[Pre]` events it might be too niche. The use case is basically \"let plugins act in case of custom `opts.load` that does not use `:packadd`\".",
