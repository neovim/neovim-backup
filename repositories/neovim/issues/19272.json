    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Feature description\n\nIn (n)vim, tab pages are essentially workspaces/viewports for a collection of windows. The following assumes that tab pages are used like originally intended, and not \"one tab per file\" etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default tabline looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3+ file3.txt  file2.txt  2+ file3.txt  file1.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, these are rather unintuitive names for workspaces, and providing better names could make tab navigation easier out-of-the-box. I'm aware there are many plugins for customizing the tabline and do all kinds of fancy things with them, but in my opinion it would still make sense to improve the current state directly in neovim, to make for a better out-of-the-box experience (given that they are easy to implement and don't introduce more complexity). I have two things in my mind:\r\n\r\n### 1. Provide an easy way to assign custom names to tab pages\r\n\r\nE.g. `:tabname <name>`\r\n\r\nThis would be useful if one is working with multiple projects in one neovim instance and keeping a project-tab 1:1 relationship, or if one uses tab pages for different tasks or contexts. One could quickly edit tab names to be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain  testing  quickfix\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject1  project2  scratchpad\r\n```\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n### 2. Include the tab number (index) in the tab names.\r\n\r\nProvide an option to prefix each tab name with its index (wether it's the default `3+ file2.txt` or a custom name). This would simplify keyboard-driven tab navigation if one has many tabs open (via `:tabn[ext] {count}`, `{count}gt`, etc).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1: [3+] file3.txt  2: file2.txt  3: [2+] file3.txt  4: file1.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\n1: main  2: testing  3: quickfix\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, also provide a way to assign a custom color to the index to make it trivial to spot it. I'm not sure wether this requires an additional hightlight group...\r\n\r\nNote: `:tabs` already lists tab pages using their indices, but it would add an additional delay to rely on it for switching tab pages, and also adds another visual representation of tabs. So it seems more natural to use the one that is already permanently displayed at the top.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

The index is more useful than knowing how many windows a tab has, then you don't need \"aliases\" (which is overwrought imo and definitely the territory for plugins). I'd suggest a more compact format though:\r\n\r\n     1:3+ file3.txt  2: file2.txt  3:2+ file3.txt  4: file1.txt\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be to get rid of the C code that currently drives the default tabpage, and replace it with vimscript or Lua 'tabline'. This has 2 advantages:\r\n\r\n- less C code\r\n- the default 'tabline' is easy for users to copy and tweak",

The index is more useful than knowing how many windows a tab has, then you don't need \"aliases\" (which is overwrought imo and definitely the territory for plugins).\r\n\r\nI have thought about this again and I have to disagree. I do not think that providing a command for renaming the current tab is the territory of plugins, in fact, to me it seems like one of the most basic features one would expect when working with tabs.\r\n\r\nWith the current default behavior, the name of the currently focused window within a tab takes up most of the space of the tab name. This seems rather unergonomic to me: Going with the original assumption that tabs are used as \"workspaces\" and not \"one file per tab\", there are generally multiple windows open per tab. That means that when the focus changes to a different window in a tab, this generally causes a major part of the tab name to change. IMO, this makes orientation between tabs harder.\r\n\r\nRight now, opening a new file in a new window changes almost everything of the tab name. With the proposed changes, there at least remains the index prefix, so there is some \"constant\" in the tab name, making it easier to identify it. But, while your proposed format `1:3+ file3.txt` @justinmk packs more information in less space, the index prefix is not as easily visually distinguishable from the rest of the tab name as in my original proposal `1: [3+] file3.txt`. That's just something to keep in mind / to consider, I do not have a strong opinion about this. IMHO, even just a mere index as a tab name is more ergonomic than either of the above options, since it remains constant over time and doesn't change the tab name on simple window focus switches, and is easily distinguishable... If going with the more compact format `1:3+ file3.txt`, I think it would be helpful to highlight the index number `1` differently from the rest `:3+ ...`, to make it stand out a bit more.\r\n\r\nBut still, as mentioned earlier, I think a simple command to rename the current tab would be a very helpful and unobtrusive change to make working with tabs easier. But I'm also not familiar with neovim's codebase, so it might actually not be as easy to implement/maintain as I imagine...\r\n\r\nEdit: ^This is all from an end user's perspective.",
