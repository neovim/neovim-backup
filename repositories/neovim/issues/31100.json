Using these, I can force something I've yanked to paste \"on its own line\", even when the yanked text is not a full line.\n\nPrecedent for other additions: \n\n- #30984 \n- #30943\n\ncc @gpanders\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd like those to be present.\n\nCounterpoint: it seems like https://github.com/tummetott/unimpaired.nvim does not have `]p`/`[p`. Maybe that means that few people use it.\n\nThese mappings being missing from unimpaired.nvim also means I haven't figured out an effective/short way to define these myself to tide me over.
