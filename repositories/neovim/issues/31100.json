Using these, I can force something I've yanked to paste \"on its own line\", even when the yanked text is not a full line.\n\nPrecedent for other additions: \n\n- #30984 \n- #30943\n\ncc @gpanders\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd like those to be present.\n\nCounterpoint: it seems like https://github.com/tummetott/unimpaired.nvim does not have `]p`/`[p`. Maybe that means that few people use it.\n\nThese mappings being missing from unimpaired.nvim also means I haven't figured out an effective/short way to define these myself to tide me over.

            "body": "There are three differences between `:iput` and `]p` that I have noticed:\n\n1. `:iput` puts the cursor at the end of the pasted text so it works more like `gp` (though not quite), whereas `]p` puts the cursor at the start of the pasted text, so it acts just like a typical linewise `p`.\n2. Being an ex command, `:iput` does not interact well with counts, e.g. typing `3:iput` pastes the text 3 lines below the cursor, instead of pasting the text 3 times as one might want to do.\n3. `:iput` also does not interact well with the dot command. It seems to just do whatever normal command action was done last, instead of repeating the `:iput` command.\n\nFor these reasons, and also because characterwise `]p` makes no sense, I think it would be great to have linewise `]p` baked into stock Neovim as well, in addition to `:iput`.\n\nRelatedly, just as much as `]p`, I tend to use `=p` and `>p`, so I would love to have all the variations from unimpaired included.\n\nThe following is what I currently have in my vimrc. It works with registers (so e.g. `\"a=p` works), counts (so e.g. `3]p` works), the dot command (so e.g. `[p....` works as expected), and puts the cursor in the expected position just like a typical linewise `p` or `P`.\n\n```vim\nif 1\n  function! s:LinewisePasteOp(type) abort\n    let s_type = getregtype('s')\n    if has('patch-7.4.513')\n      let s_contents = getreg('s', 1, 1)\n      let reg = getreg(v:register, 1, 1)\n    else\n      let s_contents = getreg('s')\n      let reg = getreg(v:register)\n    endif\n    call setreg('s', reg, 'l')\n    let l:do_after_paste = (s:post_paste ==# '' ?
