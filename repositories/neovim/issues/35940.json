    "body": "### Problem\n\nAs a Neovim user I want to be able to use the built-in plugin manager to manage non-plugin dependencies as well. These will need to be installed to a different location than plugins, so I need some way of telling Neovim where to put them.\n\nIn my plugin [rainbow-delimiters.nvim](https://github.com/HiPhish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim) I have a number of dependencies while testing. Two of them are plugins, but three are arbitrary Git repositories.\n\nPlugins:\n\n- [nvim-treesitter](test/xdg/local/share/nvim/site/pack/testing/start/nvim-treesitter)\n- [yo-dawg.nvim](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/yo-dawg.nvim.git)\n\nNon-plugins:\n\n- [LuaCATS type definitions for luassert](https://github.com/LuaCATS/luassert)\n- [LuaCATS type definitions for busted](https://github.com/LuaCATS/busted)\n- [Busted testing shims](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/nvim-busted-shims.git)\n\nUntil now I have used Git submodules to manage all of these. The downside is that plugin managers would download all the submodules by default, bloating the users' setup with stuff that's only needed for contributors. I am able to move the two plugin dependencies over to `vim.plug` inside the test configuration. However, the non-plugin dependencies still need to be installed to different paths.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMy proposition is to add a `path` field to the package spec:\n\n```lua\nvim.pack.add {\n\t{\n\t\tsrc = 'https://github.com/LuaCATS/luassert',\n\t\tversion = 'main',\n\t\tpath = '.luals/addons/luassert',  -- Note the custom path\n\t}, {\n\t\tsrc = 'https://github.com/LuaCATS/busted',\n\t\tversion = 'main',\n\t\tpath = '.luals/addons/luassert',  -- Note the custom path\n\t}, {\n\t\tsrc = 'https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/nvim-busted-shims.git',\n\t\tversion = 'master',\n\t\tpath = 'https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/nvim-busted-shims.git',  -- Note the custom path\n\t}, {\n\t\tsrc = 'https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter',\n\t\tversion = 'main',\n\t}, {\n\t\tsrc = 'https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/yo-dawg.nvim.git',\n\t\tversion = 'master',\n\t},\n}\n```\n\nI can understand if it is considered out of scope for a Neovim plugin manager to manage things other than Neovim plugins, but I wanted to bring up the proposal anyway. Maybe there is a way this could be of use to Neovim plugins as well?",
