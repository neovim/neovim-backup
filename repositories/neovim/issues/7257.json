Even though other ways of doing things may be more powerful, there are still users who'd prefer to use them.\r\n\r\nThere are some definite problems with \"virtual cursors\" like in [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors).\r\n\r\n>Is not that easy. It also requires multiple buffers, like when you copy using (i.e.) six carets and then pastes accordingly in the six current positions.\r\n\r\n>This also means every caret can have it's own selection and context, so the solution of \"virtual carets\" is unfeasible because when (for example) a plugin relies on a caret-position-change-event it will break thanks to the wrongly assumption that the event did indeed happen.\r\n\r\n~ @Ivanca\r\n\r\nThere's already been plenty of discussion on this, so let's try to keep away from \"why\" (because people want it, and it's useful for some things) and focus on the \"how\". That is, how to expand vims underlying metaphors to support multiple cursors cleanly and powerfully.",

            "body": "> placing a cursor with the mouse\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what I meant. Perhaps also removing a cursor if an existing cursor was clicked. In VSCode though I remember there was a problem with conflicting keybindings (ctrl+click would follow the definition instead of placing a cursor). https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3091 Not saying it's a problem in vim, just pointing out gotchas in other editors.\r\n\r\n> cascading mouse motions to all cursors\r\n\r\nHm, never thought of that. Like what actions? Selection?\r\n\r\n> The only thing that makes sense to me: let the \"primary cursor\" operate the menu, and whatever choice is made there is duplicated at the other cursors\r\n\r\nThat sounds reasonable, though the devil could be in the details. I basically wanted to point out that it's a very huge bummer that completion menu cannot be used with current implementation of https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors, while other editors do that (like VSCode). To me, it's probably issue number one right now (along with general instability and unpredictable behavior -- if you press something beyond the plugin's prime, vim's gonna burst with errors corrupting text along the way).\r\n\r\n> Like a MulticursorPre autocmd ?\r\n\r\nProbably yes, what I meant is this: https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors#interactions-with-other-plugins\r\nBut again, it depends on the core implementation details. The reason why such mechanism is needed in vim-multiple-cursors is because the plugin is somewhat naive and its actions are observed by other plugins such as deoplete, neocomplete or YouCompleteMe and excessive (sometimes harmful) work is performed as a result. Maybe there are ways to implement it transparently to all the plugins, or maybe there could be a reason to expose some API, I just don't know at the moment. Maybe plugin authors have ideas about that, e.g. @Shougo or @Valloric.\r\n\r\nAs for copy/paste, two scenarios are intuitive: 1) copy \"something\" using one cursor, create N cursors, paste that \"something\" into N locations 2) create N cursors, copy something, move cursors, paste. Each cursor should paste it's own data (a part of that implemented in https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors/pull/110).\r\n\r\nAnother minor \"nice-to-have\"s are:\r\n* search for the whole next word if in Normal mode\r\n* search for exact text if in Visual mode (both are currently working as expected in the plugin and have an option to toggle)\r\n* convert search results into cursors (in a file or in a selection).\r\n* mappings for actions like FindNext, GoBack (undo FindNext), SkipCurrent.\r\n\r\nLooking through https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors/issues may give more ideas about what users expect from a multiplecursor feature and the current state of things.",

I remember someone posting links to video recordings of a vim meetup in Berlin where you talked about your prototype and demonstrated it. That's great news indeed! Do you have any estimates or plans when it could go public? Maybe it could attract more contributors, maybe even students could offer their help as it was with the initial implementation of `inccommand` feature?",

If we will be able to add multi cursors with macroses or mappings and abbreviations to certain positions from normal mode, then basically it will become a snippet engine. I'm currently using my own silly snippet engine based on abbreviations, and hideously complex macroses, and with multi cursor support I will be able to do it much easier. Take a look:\r\n\r\nClass snippet and getter+setter snippets:\r\n![class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161104-1f8ef1c0-34d1-11e8-9ef6-3f4d6756b768.gif)\r\n\r\nMain and for snippets:\r\n![main_for](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161066-c1d26f6c-34d0-11e8-8dcc-52c8aa5fd9d3.gif)\r\n\r\nAnd this is how getter/setter is done:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161099-15fb22fa-34d1-11e8-9af1-8f744240e57f.png)\r\nAnd `for` snippet with jump markers:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161123-8765913c-34d1-11e8-8633-c39eceb65712.png)\r\nAbbreviation that triggers `for` apperiance and then triggers jump mapping:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161204-09f511c6-34d3-11e8-821f-eb33bec9a3a5.png)\r\nAnd this is how I jump:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161129-a5995558-34d1-11e8-98af-d49ee35a7282.png)\r\n_(—  Andrey you could just use Ultisnips ot snipmate or even visual studio code with neovim plugin!_\r\n_—  No! Thats boring!)_\r\n\r\nSo I developed this a while ago, and it is usable, except that i need 2 different mappings to replace single placeholder and another to replace several placeholders simultaniously, but in VS Code (I did not accidentally mentionid it above) it is done with multicursor, like so:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/38161189-bc4e14d6-34d2-11e8-9a29-83a6260a95c9.png)\r\nand we can jump between them. And as it is multicrusor, it will change text everywhere, so I won't need to use abbreviation hacks like double `/` symbol that is being placed right before cursor `|` in `%s/\\<placeholder\\>|/g` to achieve the same behaviour.\r\n\r\nI know it is complex tricks if you didn't done this before, and I believe that advanced multicursor usage will make such cool stuff easier to make, and I just wanted to mention it here, because just voting for feature is not enough for me.",

I don't know how it will be implemented in neovim, but I believe that it shold be sort of separate multi cursor mode, like normal, insert, mc_normal, mc_visual, etc. It will be more generic and will fit better in vim filosophy.\r\n\r\nBut having a plugin that may extend this modes (if it will be implemented lise so) will be good point. Something like how surround.vim adds new semantics to exisiting modes, but for multicursor mode with multicursor features.",

That plugin is limited in what it can do (it implements only a subset of the things you can do in other editors with multiple cursors), it's also slow and it doesn't work well with neovim in general(in my own experience). I'm sure vim can do much better than this.\r\n\r\n@andreyorst it's true that mappings could be an issue. I'm mostly using \\<buffer> mappings (if one wanted, only one non-\\<buffer> mapping would be necessary, to start the mode), that are mapped when the visual-multi mode starts, and are unmapped when it is exited. Still, they could overwrite other \\<buffer> mappings and clear them on exit. It's already possible to toggle motion mappings ('w', 'b', etc) and one would use the arrow keys to move cursors/extending selections, and normal keys for the rest (à la Sublime Text, that is). No problems there.",

Also, inverting verb-object to object-verb feels much more natural. Unfortunately, kakoune is too much work to learn properly, and so most people never get a good taste of what a better text editor would feel like. Nvim is perfectly positionned right now to change all that; lua and msgpack, along with maybe a few API changes, should be able to do this job quite well.",

While I appreciate many things of neovim (I wouldn't be switching back to it otherwise!), I find that the lack of first-class support for multi-cursor selections and operations is a major drawback. In fact, it's hard to believe for me that there's still debate on whether it's a good idea or not, superior or not to regex or whatever, or that one should first master vi techniques. I think that multi-cursor operations are great, the reasons for that are well explained by the authors of kakoune and, probably more important, the success of such feature across different editors speaks for itself. Of course, they don't replace regex or other, just as a car doesn't replace a bike, nor a truck.\r\n\r\nIt's quite clear that the there's not much interest for such feature from the main developers of neovim, but I would strongly encourage them to try it out!",
