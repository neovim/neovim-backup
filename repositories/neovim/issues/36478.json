    "body": "### Problem\n\n`:Tutor<Enter>` seems to be broken on Windows. It doesn't open the tutorial / nothing really happens. \n\nI tested the following stable versions:\n`0.11.4`: ✅ \n`0.11.5`: ❌\n\nAt time of writing, `0.11.5` is the latest stable release. Both were installed via `winget` with the following command:\n```\nwinget install Neovim.Neovim --version <version>\n```\n\nFor `0.11.5` I also tried the GitHub releases installer, with no success. Additionally, I tried the latest nightly, which also failed:\n```\n NVIM v0.12.0-dev-1573+g466b2ac192\nBuild type: RelWithDebInfo\nLuaJIT 2.1.1762386122\n```\n\nI tried launching with `--clean` as well, just in case. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Install neovim `0.11.5` \n2. Try to run the tutor with `:Tutor<Enter>`. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe tutor runs correctly. \n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.11.5 \n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 24H2 (26100.6899)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal 1.23.12811.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A\n\n### Installation\n\nwinget / official installer from GitHub ",
