This cause things like the intro text to flicker. And if the screen resizes the buffer texts(& UI elements) get shown on the wrong spot.\n\n> I also have to wrap a lot of the functions in `vim.schedule()` which is a bit annoying, but not exactly an issue. And they seem to be a lot more prone to errors(when calling API functions)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCan we either,\n\n1. Make UI events not trigger on idle (or some way to determine if the UI state has changed from the last trigger of that event).\n2. Add an `ext_window` option to `nvim_open_win()` that allows creating UI windows. UI windows can update when other windows can't.",
