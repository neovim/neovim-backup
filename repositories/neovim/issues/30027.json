My guess would be that this describes two sets of people: who actually use folds and who don't know about folds (and did not encounter problems with the default `foldmethod=manual` which use about 59% of respondents).\r\n\r\nI personally love using folds with `foldmethod=indent` (which is quite universal and works in at least 90% of cases).",
