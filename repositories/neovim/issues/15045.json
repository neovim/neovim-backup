That would be fine in other languages but in this case, Lua treats `0` as true which makes it tedious to use said functions and also quite surprising and error-prone in case you forget.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I don't think this is fixable, there's a lot of code that checks against `1` and `0` that'd just instantly break.  However, I think there should at least be some warning in the docs.",
