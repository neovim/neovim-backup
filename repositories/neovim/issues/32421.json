One possible approach can be to present the information inline in the editor with lower contrast.\n\nIn our world, this would probably present with a multiline completion with virtual ghost text\n\nThere is also the completion [triggerKind](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.18/specification/#inlineCompletionTriggerKind)\nWhich shows if the completion was requested manually or automatically (In our case probably via some sort of TextChanged autocommand).\n\nWe would need to consider the cancellation of requests in the auto command.\n\nThe primary use case is for completions from an AI LSP like copilot:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot-language-server\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSupport the new method",
