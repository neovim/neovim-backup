I've glanced over it a few times and never closely looked at the links, because I generally \"don't care\" about other implementations of `vim.indent` in Lua, and from a quick glance, that's what it had seemed like the links were for -- but that seems completely not the case, as looking at the source code shows `vim.indent` is literally `inspect.lua` vendored. That seems unclear to me, and I think it'd be useful to call that out explicitly so users know this isn't just a tangential see also, it's \"more docs are over here\".\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-973+gb7e896671-Homebrew\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.0.1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nKitty 0.36.4\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nHomebrew --head",
