    "body": "[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) uses `buftype=prompt` for the debug REPL.\r\n\r\nIt looks as if by default any input to a prompt buffer sets the `modified` flag. This is a bit annoying for the REPL case, because users usually don't care whether the REPL is modified or not and they shouldn't get a \"Did not save [dap-repl]\" message. So I added something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\napi.nvim_buf_attach(buf, false, {\r\n  on_lines = function(b)\r\n    api.nvim_buf_set_option(b, 'modified', false)\r\n  end;\r\n  on_changedtick = function(b)\r\n    api.nvim_buf_set_option(b, 'modified', false)\r\n  end;\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this workaround had the side effect of [breaking the backspace key](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/issues/119) in that after you type something you can no longer remove the characters with backspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any other good way to that would allow to treat a prompt buffer like a terminal or `nofile` where modifications don't matter?\r\n",
