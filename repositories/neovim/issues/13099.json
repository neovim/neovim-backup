But the lists can be set by basically everyone, causing no event the user could listen to.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nAn event gets thrown when ever `setqflist` or `setloclist` got called.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSorry if this was already discussed once. I was not able to find such conversation. \r\nI know there should not be an event for every rare use-case. But in fact this event(s) do already exist, just that they do not apply not for everything. Why emitting an event for specific commands only rather than make it more generic?\r\nTo finally make an example where this could be useful would be a status segment that highlights if and how much location lists entry exist. So there is no need to automatically open the location list (if such feature is provided), but the user can have a visual feedback if any asynchronous tool is adding location or quickfix list entries.\r\nThanks for any input!\r\n",

Here's my solution for something I wrote for myself. (This may not be the most elegant solution, but it works.)\n\nFirst, in an initialization function, I create the User autocommand:\n\n```lua\n local refinery_augroup =\n        vim.api.nvim_create_augroup(\"RefineryAugroup\", { clear = true })\n    -- Create a no-op autocommand to fire after filling QuickFix list.\n    -- This is not required, but it provides a place for a description.\n    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"User\", {\n        pattern = \"RefineryQuickFixCmdPost\",\n        command = \"execute\",\n        group = refinery_augroup,\n        desc = \"No-op autocommand that provides a hook event for refinery.nvim\",\n    })\n```\n\nIn another file, after I call `setqflist`, I fire that autocommand:\n\n```lua\nlocal on_exit = function(stream, title, efm)\n    -- ...\n    vim.fn.setqflist({}, \" \", {\n        lines = lines,\n        title = title,\n        efm = efm,\n    })\n\n    vim.api.nvim_exec_autocmds(\n        \"User\",\n        { pattern = \"RefineryQuickFixCmdPost\", modeline = false }\n    )\nend\n```\n\nThe user can then set autocommands on `RefineryQuickFixCmdPost` as if that were a built-in autocommand:\n\n```lua\n-- Open quickfix window after refinery.nvim adds items to it.\ncreate_autocmd(\"User\", {\n    pattern = \"RefineryQuickFixCmdPost\",\n    command = \":cwindow\",\n    group = telemachus_augroup,\n})\n```\n",

In that case, they wouldn't be supporting *your* custom autocommand. Instead, they would add their own custom autocommand, and you would use that in your configuration files. For example, see the [autocommands section in paq's documentation](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim/blob/master/doc/paq-nvim.txt#L339-L355).\n\ntl;dr - you need to lobby the plugins to include an autocommand hook.",
