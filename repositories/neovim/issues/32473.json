    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe problem is the regex incompatibility between neovim and other cli tools.\n\nThere is a great neovim extension: nvim-spectre for find/replace, but looking at it's readme this makes me very sad:\n- It has different regex syntax compared to the `rg` command and\n  replace command `sed` so be careful when replacing text.\n- It has a different highlighting result because I use vim regex to\n  highlight text so be careful but you can try to replace.\n- If possible, we recommend building and using rust oxi engine to replace.\n\nI've seen a couple of issues on this repo about replacing/integrating pcre, but it seems not an easy thing, so I think it's might be easier to do the reverse: extending vim's regex syntax outside vim, for example we can have vimgrep, vimsed tools, replacements for the standard grep and sed tools, but using vim's regex syntax, so we can avoid regex incompatibility issues using extensions like nvim-spectre.\n\nI don't know how hard it can be to do this, so sorry for this issue, I'm just a neovim user and I don't understand it's internal structure.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nregex compatibility when using extensions like nvim-spectre",

If you want to use Vim regex outside of Nvim, you can already do that by writing standalone Lua scripts using `vim.regex` that can be run with `nvim -l script.lua` (or even `./script.lua` with the right shebang).",
