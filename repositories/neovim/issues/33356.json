Plugin developers wanting to support multiple backends or allow users to choose their preferred service must implement and maintain separate integration logic for each one. This leads to:\n\n*   **Redundant Effort:** Boilerplate code for API interaction, error handling, and configuration is duplicated across plugins.\n*   **Inconsistency:** Users face different configuration experiences and potentially different behaviors depending on the plugin and the backend it uses.\n*   **Higher Barrier to Entry:** The complexity of managing these integrations discourages developers from building new AI-powered features or experimenting with different models.\n\nWhile the GSoC project aims to add specific UI/UX features like inline completion and improved prompt buffers (#32084), implementing these robustly *across different potential AI backends* is hampered by this underlying integration challenge.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nTo address the integration problem and provide a solid foundation for AI plugin development (including the features mentioned in #32084), this proposal suggests creating a standardized **AI Provider and Model Interface** within Neovim core, likely exposed via a new Lua module (e.g., `vim.ai`).\n\n**How it solves the problem:**\n\n1.  **Abstraction:** This interface would act as an abstraction layer. Plugins would interact with a consistent `vim.ai` API, regardless of the underlying AI service being used.\n2.  **Standardization:** It defines standard ways to:\n    *   Represent AI Service Providers (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.) and their capabilities.\n    *   Represent AI Models (gpt-4, llama3, etc.) and their features (inference, streaming, token counting).\n    *   Register new provider implementations (allowing community contributions).\n    *   Query available providers/models.\n    *   Select and interact with models for tasks like completion or chat.\n3.  **Centralized Configuration:** Provides standard mechanisms for users to configure their preferred AI providers and models (e.g., `vim.g.ai_default_chat_model`), potentially including secure credential management.\n\n**Benefits (Is it worth the cost?):**\n\n*   **Simplifies Plugin Development:** Drastically reduces the effort needed to add AI capabilities, allowing developers to focus on UI/UX rather than backend integration.\n*   **Promotes Consistency:** Users get a more unified experience across different AI plugins.\n*   **Encourages Innovation:** Lowers the barrier for creating new AI tools for Neovim.\n*   **Facilitates GSoC Goals:** Provides a robust backend mechanism that simplifies the implementation of features like `textDocument/inlineCompletion` or AI-powered prompt buffers, making them readily usable with various AI services.\n\nThe cost involves adding a new module to the core, but the abstraction it provides is expected to significantly outweigh this by fostering a richer, more maintainable, and easier-to-develop AI plugin ecosystem.\n\n**Discussion:**\nI've started a discussion thread for broader feedback on this approach here: #33355\n\n\n**Proposal Status:**\nI am preparing a detailed GSoC proposal based on this concept (deadline April 8th). This issue serves to track the idea within the Neovim issue tracker as per GSoC guidelines.\n",

            "body": "**this is the first draft of the proposal , I only omited the \"personal info\" and \"timeline\" section**.\n**would be happy the hear  your valuable feedback and make any necessary changes.**\n\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly become an integral part of the modern software development lifecycle, offering significant potential to accelerate workflows and enhance productivity. The rising popularity of AI-centric development environments (like Cursor) and integrated plugins (such as GitHub Copilot) demonstrates the value developers place on AI assistance. While Neovim itself may not integrate specific AI features directly into the core, the GSoC project description indicates a clear goal: to empower the community by providing robust, fundamental building blocks (primitives). These primitives are intended to facilitate the creation of sophisticated and high-quality AI plugins for tasks like code completion, chat interfaces, and more. This proposal outlines a plan to contribute to the development of these foundational AI primitives within Neovim.\n\n\n## **Core Requirements from GSoC Description**\n\nThe GSoC project description for \"AI primitives\" lists several key features to facilitate AI plugin development:\n\n*   LSP `textDocument/inlineCompletion` support (LSP 3.18).\n*   Buffer/window \"busy\" or \"in progress\" status indication (compatible with default/custom statuslines).\n*   A standard library \"progress meter\" interface.\n*   Enhancements to the \"prompt buffer\" concept (multiline input, paste, dedicated filetype/highlighting, standard mappings).\n\nAddressing these specific features is important. However, this proposal suggests that a more fundamental challenge for AI plugin developers lies in the complexity of integrating with diverse AI models and service providers. Therefore, the primary focus of this proposal is to introduce a standardized **AI Provider and Model Interface** within Neovim. This foundational layer aims to simplify development, promote consistency, and ultimately provide a more robust base upon which features like those listed above can be built and maintained effectively.\n\n\n\n## **Challenges in AI Plugin Development**\n\nWhile the features outlined in the GSoC description (such as inline completion, progress indicators, and improved prompt buffers) are valuable additions, they primarily address the *user-facing* aspects of AI integration. Developers building these plugins face several underlying technical hurdles:\n\n*   **AI Model and Provider Integration:** This is arguably on of the most significant obstacle. Integrating with the rapidly growing landscape of AI models (e.g., GPT variants, Llama, Claude) and service providers (OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Ollama, Hugging Face, etc.) presents considerable complexity. Developers must work alot with disparate APIs, varying authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth), rate limiting, inconsistent response formats, and differing feature sets (e.g., streaming, function calling). Managing this diversity within each plugin creates redundant effort and hinders interoperability.\n\nBeyond integration, developers also grapple with:\n\n*   **Performance:** Ensuring AI interactions (like fetching completions or chat responses) are asynchronous and do not block the Neovim UI is crucial for a smooth user experience.\n*   **User Experience (UX):** Crafting intuitive interfaces for interacting with AI, handling errors gracefully, and providing clear feedback requires careful design.\n*   **Security:** Handling potentially sensitive data (like API keys or code snippets sent to external services) requires robust security practices.\n*   **Customization:** Enabling users to configure preferred models, providers, and behavior patterns is essential for accommodating diverse workflows.\n\nAddressing the core challenge of **AI Model and Provider Integration** is key to unlocking the potential for a vibrant AI plugin ecosystem. The following section details a proposed solution designed to tackle this fundamental issue directly.\n\n\n\n## **Proposed Solution: AI Provider and Model Interface**\n\nTo address the fundamental challenge of AI integration and simplify plugin development, this proposal introduce a an implementation of a standardized **AI Provider and Model Interface** within Neovim. This interface will serve as an abstraction layer, decoupling AI-consuming plugins from the specifics of individual AI services and models, while deferring the implementation of each provider/modle api logic handling to designated plugins.\n\nThe core components of this proposed interface include:\n\n1.  **Abstract Definitions:**\n    *   **AI Service Providers:** A standardized representation for entities like OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Ollama, etc. This definition would include capabilities such as:\n        *   Listing available models offered by the provider.\n        *   Checking provider availability and validating credentials (e.g., API key checks).\n        *   Declaring supported features at the provider level .\n    *   **AI Models:** A standardized representation for specific models like `gpt-4`, `claude-3-opus`, `llama3`, etc. This definition would encapsulate model-specific functionalities, including:\n        *   **Inference Operations:** Functions for sending prompts, receiving responses (including support for streaming), and potentially handling other model-specific interactions (like function calling or structured output generation).\n        *   **Metadata and Utility Functions:** Methods for token counting, cost estimation (where applicable), and retrieving model capabilities.\n        *   Declaring supported features at the model level ( streaming, function calling ,thinking effort .. etc) .\n\n2.  **Internal Neovim API:** A Lua API (`vim.ai` or similar) designed for plugin developers to interact with the abstraction layer. This API would enable plugins to:\n    *   Register new AI Service Provider implementations (allowing community contributions for different backends by developing plugins to support different providers ). [ this api will be used by ai-providing plugins]\n    *   Query available providers and their models. [ this and below 2 api's will be used by ai-consuming plugins ]\n    *   Select and interact with specific AI models for tasks like completion or chat.\n    *   Discover models based on desired features (e.g., find a model supporting streaming chat, or find a model suitable for code completion).\n\n3.  **Global State and Configuration:** Centralized mechanisms within Neovim for managing AI configurations:\n    *   **User Settings:** Options to define default models for common tasks (e.g., `vim.g.ai_default_chat_model`, `vim.g.ai_default_completion_model`), allowing different plugins to leverage the user's preferred setup.\n    *   **Provider Management:** Secure storage and handling of credentials (potentially leveraging existing Neovim mechanisms or external tools).\n    *   **(Potential) Cost Management:** Exploring mechanisms to track estimated costs and potentially enforce user-defined budgets, preventing unexpected expenses.\n\nBy establishing this standardized interface, Neovim can significantly lower the barrier to entry for AI plugin development, promote code reuse, enhance performance through standardized asynchronous operations, and provide a consistent configuration experience for end-users across different AI plugins. This foundational layer will also provide a solid base upon which the user-facing features mentioned in the GSoC description (like inline completion and prompt buffers) can be more easily and robustly implemented.\n\n\n\n## **Benefits of the Proposed Interface**\n\nImplementing the AI Provider and Model Interface offers several key advantages:\n\n*   **Reduced Development Effort:** By providing a unified API, plugin authors are saved significant time and effort previously spent on integrating with diverse AI services individually. This allows them to focus on building innovative user-facing features rather than boilerplate integration code.\n*   **Increased Productivity & Creativity:** Lowering the integration barrier encourages more developers to experiment with and incorporate AI capabilities into their plugins, potentially leading to a richer and more diverse AI plugin ecosystem for Neovim users.\n*   **Improved Consistency and User Experience:** Centralized configuration (e.g., default models) and standardized interactions ensure a more consistent experience for users across different AI plugins.\n*   **Enhanced Maintainability:**\n    *   **Separation of Concerns:** The interface promotes a clear separation between plugins providing AI service access (which focus on API details, authentication, performance) and plugins consuming AI features (which focus on UI/UX).\n    *   **Community-Driven Maintenance:** While Neovim core maintains the interface definition and core API, the responsibility for implementing and updating specific provider integrations can largely fall to the community or individual plugin authors, distributing the maintenance load. The generic nature of the interface minimizes the core maintenance burden even as the AI landscape evolves.\n*   **Feasibility:** Many AI providers utilize similar API concepts and terminology (e.g., prompts, responses, streaming, models), making the creation of a feasible and effective unified interface achievable.\n\n## **Potential Challenges and Mitigation**\n\n*   **Rapid Evolution of AI:** The AI field is constantly evolving, with new models, features, and APIs emerging frequently. This poses a potential maintenance challenge.\n    *   **Mitigation:** The proposed solution addresses this through a well-defined, extensible interface. The core interface can remain relatively stable, while new features or providers can be added via new implementations or extensions to the interface definitions, often managed by the community rather than requiring constant core changes. The focus is on providing the *abstraction*, not on implementing every specific feature of every provider directly in the core.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **Implementation Plan / Deliverables**\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to establish the foundational AI infrastructure within Neovim. The core deliverables include:\n\n1.  **AI Provider and Model Interface Implementation:**\n    *   Design and implement the Lua API (`vim.ai` or similar) for provider registration, model querying, and interaction.\n    *   Implement the abstract definitions for AI Service Providers and AI Models.\n    *   Develop the necessary global state management and configuration options (e.g., default model settings, potential credential handling strategy).\n\n2.  **Implementation of GSoC Core Features:**\n    *   Implement support for `textDocument/inlineCompletion` (LSP 3.18).\n    *   Develop the buffer/window \"busy\" status indicator mechanism.\n    *   Create the standard library \"progress meter\" interface.\n    *   Implement the specified enhancements to the \"prompt buffer\" concept (multiline input, paste, filetype, highlighting, standard mappings).\n\n**Feasibility Note:** While a detailed investigation of the Neovim codebase is pending, the core features requested in the GSoC description (inline completion, progress meter, etc.) appear relatively self-contained. This suggests that implementing these features alongside the development of the AI Provider Interface is feasible within the GSoC timeframe, potentially allowing for parallel development streams.\n\n**Optional / Stretch Goals:**\n\n*   **Example Provider Implementations:** Provide concrete implementations for one or two popular AI service providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini/Vertex AI) to validate the interface design and provide a starting point for the community.\n*   **Plugin Adaptation Showcase:** Modify an existing community AI plugin (e.g., an AI chat plugin) to utilize the new `vim.ai` interface, demonstrating its benefits and ease of integration.\n",

There are many ways (examples in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32084 ) that Nvim can be improved which will help AI plugins, without required a dedicated `vim.ai` module.\n\nWith respect to your own list:\n\n> * **Performance:** Ensuring AI interactions (like fetching completions or chat responses) are asynchronous and do not block the Neovim UI is crucial for a smooth user experience.\n\nWhy does this require `vim.ai`? \n\nAI plugins need to make http/service requests. Improving Nvim's basic features to make requests (e.g. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23232 ) is generally useful and valuable. Doesn't require `vim.ai`.\n\n> * **User Experience (UX):** Crafting intuitive interfaces for interacting with AI, handling errors gracefully, and providing clear feedback requires careful design.\n\nYes, and #32084 describes some UI features that would help with that. But there is no reason these are \"AI only\".\n\n> * **Security:** Handling potentially sensitive data (like API keys or code snippets sent to external services) requires robust security practices.\n\nWhat are some ways that could be improved? Your proposal doesn't discuss this.\n\n> * **Customization:** Enabling users to configure preferred models, providers, and behavior patterns is essential for accommodating diverse workflows.\n\nI think this proposal was written by an LLM.",
