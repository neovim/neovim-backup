Although I prefer to keep it out of my way by setting `mouse=`, I'm faced with many instances where I needed a quick momentary mouse activation.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI suggest using the same shift key modifier to temporarily disable the mouse events capture.",

I understand cmdline is always an option, but some cases are not worth more than a single keypress 🙂 \n\nI can't find a relevant open issue enabling this feature. My understanding is that mouse events with or without the shift modifier are correctly forwarded from the terminal to Neovim. Isn't that how the inverse is behaving; i.e the momentary deactivation of mouse event captures using the shift key.",
