The path forward for this is #21635\r\n\r\nGiven that #21635 is explicitly about auto-installing nvim remotely and using the client/server capabilities of nvim, while scp copies the remote file locally and does all the editing locally, I'd say that, for me at least, these are 2 different use cases entirely.\r\nI don't want to install a copy of nvim remotely. I want to copy the file to my local machine, edit it, and send it back. Netrw allows me to do just that.\r\nGiven that netrw is documented in the official help files, is (largely) perfectly functional, and is not marked as deprecated for nvim in any place a normal user like myself would notice, declaring it unsupported in favour of a feature that doesn't exist yet and actually does something else entirely seems a bit premature to me.\r\nHowever, if is the case that netrw is no longer supported, I would like to migrate my workflow to the replacement sooner rather than later.\r\nWhat is the interim solution for editing a file off a remote server, while #21635 is still under development?",
