    "body": "### Problem\n\nI think this is a problem with `vim.lsp.tagfunc`, so I put it this category.\n\n## Problem\n\nConsider this minimal typescript file:\n```ts\ninterface Iface {\n}\nconst iface = 1;\n\nconst thing = null;\nconst Thing = 2;\n\nconst Other = 3;\nfunction _() {\n    const other = null;\n}\n\nfunction main() {\n    const x = Thing;\n    const y: Iface = {};\n    const z = Other;\n}\nconst x = Thing;\nconst y: Iface = {};\nconst z = Other;\n```\nThe problem is basically that if you do `:tag` with one of the uppercase symbols, it goes to the lower case one no matter what. I have put multiple cases above to show that it happens in all kinds of situations, regardless of order of appearance, kind of symbol, etc. The most peculiar is `:tag Other` for which it goes to an out of scope variable `other` inside that other function!\n\nThis problem does not happen for these actions: `:lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()`, `C-]`, `C-w }` and `C-w ]`. So, I don't think its a language server problem. Weirdly, `:h C-]` (or any of the others) says it calls `:tag` internally.\n\nI haven't changed any of the `*case` options at all, but here are their defaults anyway: `noignorecase nosmartcase tagcase=followic`. Just in case, I checked that this happens with `tagcase=match` as well.\n\nAside, another issue I noticed but I'm not sure I should make a separate issue for, is that `vim.lsp.tagfunc` doesn't seem to support `i_CTRL-X_CTRL_]`\n\n## Reproduction\n\n - Checkout the latest stable(8b98642002d0506d20628683958cb5c97a0dad80) or the latest master(b34e137e43d359c8db4fb76028dea3b410842aff) (it happens on both)\n   - It also happens on 80e37aa533573ef1ad96bcccc006b8d45dc963b9 fwiw\n - Save the above typescript file as `one.ts` and the below lua file as `repro.lua` in the neovim directory itself\n - `make distclean && make clean && make -j$(nproc) CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`\n - Run `VIMRUNTIME=runtime build/bin/nvim -u repro.lua one.ts`\n - Try doing `:tag Other` (or any of the other uppercase ones). It will be wrong, try doing `<C-]>` with cursor on them and see that it is correct.\n\nBelow is the repro.lua for minimal reproduction.\n\n```lua\nlocal pattern = 'typescript'\nlocal cmd = {'typescript-language-server', '--stdio'}\nlocal root_markers = { 'package.json' }\nlocal settings = vim.empty_dict()\n\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {\n  pattern = pattern,\n  callback = function(args)\n    local match = vim.fs.find(root_markers, { path = args.file, upward = true })[1]\n    local root_dir = match and vim.fn.fnamemodify(match, ':p:h') or nil\n    vim.lsp.start({\n      name = 'bugged-ls',\n      cmd = cmd,\n      root_dir = root_dir,\n      settings = settings\n    })\n  end\n})\n\n-- remove effects of any user plugins in standard directories\nvim.opt.runtimepath = '/etc/xdg/nvim,/usr/local/share/nvim/site,/usr/share/nvim/site,runtime,/usr/local/lib/nvim,/usr/share/nvim/site/after,/usr/local/share/nvim/site/after,/etc/xdg/nvim/after'\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\nall given above\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nall given above\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nmaster or stable\n\n### Language server name/version\n\ntypescript-language-server 4.3.3\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux 6.11.3-arch1-1\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",

And from what I can see in `runtime/vim/lsp/_tagfunc.lua` it seems like we do `query_workspace_symbols` when flag is not `c`. Do you know why it throws a `E433: No tags file` though?

Glad I find an explanation of the behaviour at least.\n\nI get it's difficult to find a matching solution that works for everyone, but I have some suggestions to improve it:\n\n- Make `:tag` and related (`:ptag`) first look for exact matches. When I do `:ptag openPreview` (a function in an open buffer) it opens `--- @class vim.lsp.util.open_floating_preview.Opts` in the neovim source code. I like the fuzzy matching, but exact match should be the first option (I can see it is the second option if I do `:tselect`)\n- It should be looking in the cwd first before jumping to external files (like the neovim source code in my example, even if I added it in my lsp configuration).\n- The discrepancy should be noted in the docs/help. `:h <C-w>}` help says `Use identifier under cursor as a tag and perform a :ptag on it.`, which in view of this issue looks to be incorrect when using lsp and afaik there is no mention in `:h lsp-defaults` either (where the tagfunc behavior is exaplained).\n\nI guess option 3 is the easiest, but I would love to see option 1 implemented, as I think it makes the most sense.",
