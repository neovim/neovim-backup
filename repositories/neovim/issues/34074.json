    "body": "### Problem\n\nI find the new `vim._extui` feature great, thanks for the great work.  I don't believe this was reported in #27811 before, but one subtle issue I found is that messages printed by `:echon` (not `:echom`) behave differently.\n\nFor example, in vanilla Vim and neovim-0.11 the following would print '1 2 3 4' (with 2 being highlighted)\n\n```\nechon '1 '\nechohl WarningMsg | echon '2 ' | echohl NONE\nechon '3 '\nechon '4 '\n```\n\nbut with `vim._extui` I see `'2\\n3\\n4\\n1'` --- each `echon` message is printed in a separate line.\n\nNote that with `:echom` the behavior is correct (except that the very first line is shown in the bottommost line, which I guess is an orthogonal issue).\n\nA practical impact is that some vimscript-written plugins (e.g. https://github.com/tweekmonster/helpful.vim) or existing scripts that intended printing multiple chunks in a single (with some highlights) would behave differently. (e.g. just showing `...[+n]` --> these `echon`-generated messages even can't be seen as they would be never added to the message history!)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`$ nvim --clean minimal.lua` with:\n\n```lua\nrequire('vim._extui').enable {\n  enable = true,\n  msg = {\n    pos = 'cmd',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```\nechon '1 '\nechohl WarningMsg | echon '2 ' | echohl NONE\nechon '3 '\nechon '4 \n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`1 2 3 4`\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n<img width=\"655\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13240abd-c008-4217-9702-f2021f74aa82\" />\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-394+g4eed85f9bd\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNA\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNot relevant\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from source",
