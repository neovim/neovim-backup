The idea is to allow to load plugins from any local path but not manage them at all. I.e. something like this:\n- `vim.pack.add('~/my-plugins/plugin1')` adds the path to 'runtimepath' and executes 'plugin/' / 'after/plugin/' files.\n- `vim.pack.update()` and `vim.pack.del()` don't know/care about such plugins.\n\nMy personal preference is that suggesting to manually add such plugins is okay. For example, by putting such plugins in '~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/mine/start' or '.../mine/opt' and manually call `:packadd`.",

Mostly because both local plugin and lockfile support will touch a lot of the same areas.\n\nBut to answer the question, the plan is indeed something like you outlined, plus:\n- State of the plugin never changes. Be it in `vim.pack.update()` or during \"install\" / \"checkout\".\n- Confirmation buffer should show a dedicated information about it (that it is local).\n- `vim.pack.get()` should provide specification as for regular plugin, but also will probably introduce a new dedicated `type` field that will be (currently) one of `'git'` or `'local'`.\n\nI have a plan to at least try to resolve this with suggestion PR before 0.12.",
