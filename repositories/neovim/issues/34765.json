The idea is to allow to load plugins from any local path but not manage them at all. I.e. something like this:\n- `vim.pack.add('~/my-plugins/plugin1')` adds the path to 'runtimepath' and executes 'plugin/' / 'after/plugin/' files.\n- `vim.pack.update()` and `vim.pack.del()` don't know/care about such plugins.\n\nMy personal preference is that suggesting to manually add such plugins is okay. For example, by putting such plugins in '~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/mine/start' or '.../mine/opt' and manually call `:packadd`.",
