The idea is to allow to load plugins from any local path but not manage them at all. I.e. something like this:\n- `vim.pack.add('~/my-plugins/plugin1')` adds the path to 'runtimepath' and executes 'plugin/' / 'after/plugin/' files.\n- `vim.pack.update()` and `vim.pack.del()` don't know/care about such plugins.\n\nMy personal preference is that suggesting to manually add such plugins is okay. For example, by putting such plugins in '~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/mine/start' or '.../mine/opt' and manually call `:packadd`.",

Mostly because both local plugin and lockfile support will touch a lot of the same areas.\n\nBut to answer the question, the plan is indeed something like you outlined, plus:\n- State of the plugin never changes. Be it in `vim.pack.update()` or during \"install\" / \"checkout\".\n- Confirmation buffer should show a dedicated information about it (that it is local).\n- `vim.pack.get()` should provide specification as for regular plugin, but also will probably introduce a new dedicated `type` field that will be (currently) one of `'git'` or `'local'`.\n\nI have a plan to at least try to resolve this with suggestion PR before 0.12.",

I tried to create it through `vim.uv.fs_symlink(path, new_path, { junction = true })`, but I couldn't get it to work with that. I also briefly remember packer.nvim used opt/start, and judging from this commit: [wbthomason/packer.nvim@851c62c](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/commit/851c62c5ecd3b5adc91665feda8f977e104162a5) I would assume they maybe had it working\n> \n> It did however seem to work if I created the link manually in `cmd` with something like this: `mklink /J \"<path>\" \"<new_path>\"`\n\nThe junction does work on windows however you have to use absolute paths when calling `vim.uv.fs_symlink`.\n\n```lua\n:pwd\n-- C:/Users/user\n\n-- Works\n=vim.uv.fs_symlink('C:/Users/user/original_file.txt', 'C:/Users/user/junction_file.txt', { junction = true })\n\n-- Fails\n=vim.uv.fs_symlink('./original_file.txt', 'C:/Users/user/junction_file.txt', { junction = true })\n=vim.uv.fs_symlink('C:/Users/user/original_file.txt', './junction_file.txt', { junction = true })\n```\n\nAll you need to do is to resolve the absolute path first.\n\n```lua\n-- Sample\nlocal source = vim.fn.fnamemodify('./original_file.txt', ':p')\nlocal target = vim.fn.fnamemodify('./juntion_file.txt', ':p')\nvim.uv.fs_symlink(source, target, { junction = true })\n```\n\nI found that some months ago and I used `fnamemodify` as a workaround.",
