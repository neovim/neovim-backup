    "body": "### Problem\n\nVim and Neovim have concise mappings for acting on text objects. Example: `vab` selects-and-includes a pair of `()`s, `di[` deletes the contents of `[]`s. \n\nHowever there aren't many text motions available that incorporate the user's current cursor position. There are horizontal options like `dfB` to mean \"delete from the cursor to the first letter B\" but a user cannot as easily express \"delete all text starting from this cursor position up to the end of this paragraph\" as a mapping in a generic way.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAs it happens, there's a plugin that does this, https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-ninja-feet\n\nIn short: It adds \"operator-pending\" mappings that consider the cursor's current position.\n\nA typical text motion + object pair like `vap`, now has 2 more options `v[ap` and `v]ap`. `[` means \"from the start of the text object to the current cursor\" and `]` means \"from the cursor to the end of the text object\"\n\nWith built-in text objects or other plugins, examples like the following become easily possible:\n\n`v[ic` means \"select all lines that are comments from the current cursor position to the last comment\"\n`d]ip` means \"delete from the current cursor line to the end of the paragraph\"\n`gc[ii` means \"comment all of the lines from the cursor down to the last line of same indent\"\n\nNeovim has recently been added more meaningful text operations such as [built-in commenting](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28176), [unimpaired-style mappings](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/bb7604eddafb31cd38261a220243762ee013273a), and there's a GitHub issue for [adding `gs` to sort lines](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19354#issue-1303638463). Please consider adding directional text motions to improve manipulating text. What do you think?",
