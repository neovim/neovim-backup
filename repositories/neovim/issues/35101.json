Use extmarks to set URLs in terminal buffers. This is kind of a hack since we don't use extmarks anywhere else for terminal buffers right now. Also not sure what the performance implications would be.\n\n2. Provide an API to retrieve the URL (or other attributes) from a highlight attribute ID (or from an arbitrary buffer position). Since URLs are only attached to \"anonymous\" highlight attributes (not highlight groups) this would need to be a new API.",
