This means:\n\n- a stacktrace, or a performance check, can't easily say which plugin is causing a problem\n- plugins all share the top-level namespace and must manually avoid conflicts with each other\n- there is no (formal) concept of a default location for plugin logs, data, etc.\n\nRelated: plugin *name* is assigned by `vim.pack.add()` ... https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34009\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe convention established by Vimscript's `foo#bar#Baz()` dispatching, and by \"runtimepath managers\" like https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen , and plugin managers which are essentially derivatives thereof, is that a plugin \"name\" is the top-level name in `plugin/<name>.vim`, and submodules live in `plugin/<name>/*.vim`, `plugin/autoload/<name/*`, etc.\n\nWe can use this convention to get the \"name\" of a plugin, which means we can:\n\n- auto-assign a namespace based on that name\n- use that name for default \"standard path\" locations (`stdpath`) https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32546\n- mention that name in performance reports (instead of (only) script locations)\n\n\n## Related\n\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32546\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32261#issuecomment-2635417146\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32329",
