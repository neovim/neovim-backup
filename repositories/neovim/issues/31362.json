    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe quickfix list is a very useful builtin feature, especially for showing diagnostics in your workspace / buffer. It however lacks auto-updating of these diagnostics. This is something that new users coming from an IDE (like vscode) might expect, as these IDEs often also have a window with diagnostics below the buffers. It makes the overall experience with using diagnostics in the qflist much better and gives working with diagnostics a more modern feel.\n\nImplementing the qflist as diagnostic handler is fairly trivial thanks to `vim.diagnostic.handler`. However, users might not think to implement this themself. It would be great for discoverability to have this as builtin handler, even when it's turned off as default.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI currently use this in my own config:\n\n```lua\nvim.diagnostic.handlers[\"quickfix\"] = {\n  show = function(_, _, _, _)\n    vim.diagnostic.setqflist({ open = false })\n  end,\n\n  hide = function(_, _)\n    vim.fn.setqflist({}, 'r')\n  end\n}\n```\n\nand that works already quite well.\n\nThis solves the problem by creating a diagnostic handler that just sets the qflist with available diagnostics. I think the show function is called on DiagnosticChanged, thus this would update the qflist when the list of diagnostics changes. The cost is minimal, and provides a modern experience for working with diagnostics.",

Waiting for comments / objections.\n> I think the show function is called on DiagnosticChanged, thus this would update the qflist when the list of diagnostics changes. The cost is minimal, and provides a modern experience for working with diagnostics.\n\nAlso OP mentioned in the original post that it is minimal cost, i would like to say f*ck no it is not, doing this ` vim.diagnostic.setqflist({ open = false })` on each diagnostics event is not cheap at all. Re-creating the diagnostic items on the main thread, the qflist items every damn time, is not zero or minimal cost, especially if linked to workspace diagnostics and not document diagnostics.\n\nThere might be an argument here for a separate diagnostics ui window or ui element, separate from qf list in the future. There are other lsp features like the call graph, which are not suitable for qf list as well. ",

I don't think `setqflist` is computationally much heavier than setting signs, virtual lines and underlines. A separate diagnostics ui element is indeed a good suggestion, but that has a much higher complexity than this simple addition. I'm aware not everything will use or like this feature, that's why I already suggested it could be opt-in.\n\nI could throw in a `vim.schedule` in the [example docs PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31371) if you prefer that.",
