    "body": "### Problem\n\nI haven't found any issues that I think are quite the same as this, although there have been some related requests about overriding highlights/patterns, but please point me to them if someone's already asked for this!\n\nProgramatically modifying tree-sitter queries is [technically possible](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/3058#issuecomment-1166335036) today with `vim.treesitter.query.set()` and unparsed query text, but this is not ideal for slight tweaks on existing queries (or indeed for creating new queries dynamically... I guess you could generate the query string?). It seems convenient / preferable to simply get an existing query and extend/append to it for more fine-grained changes.\n\nSome possible use cases for this kind of API:\n\n1. Disable/override a single pattern from an existing builtin/upstream query, without copy-pasting the entire query just to make small changes\n    - Can \"replace\" a pattern by disabling it and adding a new `; extends` query\n    - Prevents manually updating from the upstream with another copy/paste\n1. Add a custom predicate/directive to an existing query (generalization of 1)    - Allows implementing things like buffer-local variables to toggle certain patterns\n    - Custom predicates can add metadata for use with `Inspect!`\n\nOne downside of this is that capture/pattern IDs (indices) would become a part of the external API; I believe right now they're mainly used internally by neovim for highlights etc; although users can read already them, I don't know if they can actually use them for anything? This seems to already be a stable part of the tree-sitter API though, so I don't know if there's really any reason for concern here.\n\nSome others similar feature requests have been made/attempted previously: #23373, #26303, #3058, #1346, #17802 so I think there is generally a desire for some form of this, and even if this proposal isn't the final form I think it would provide the building blocks for a more convenient feature.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI propose making two main changes that could be useful for supporting this kind of override use case:\n\n1. Expose [the treesitter APIs](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/lib/include/tree_sitter/api.h#L1019-L1034) to disable captures/queries, something like:\n    - `TSQuery:disable_capture(capture_name)`\n    - `TSQuery:disable_pattern(pattern_idx)`\n\n   The caveat of these APIs is they appear to be irreversible, so they wouldn't be as generally useful, but I think there is still utility for e.g. overriding a single pattern or disabling a particular highlight.\n\n2. Support modifying queries in Lua and registering the modified query, for example:\n```lua\nlocal q = vim.treesitter.query.get('lua', 'highlights')\n-- Do some modifications to q, e.g. inserting new predicates\ntable.insert(q.info.patterns[1], {'eq?', 0, 'foo'})\n-- Tell nvim to use the modified query. This could alternately be its own separate function:\nvim.treesitter.query.set('lua', 'highlights', q)\n```\n\n\nI have written a proof-of-concept that shows both of these options generally work, but I wanted to open an issue first to see if this kind of proposal makes sense and would be accepted. If so I am happy to open a PR implementing this change!",

For example, one case I thought of was something like an `#is-injected?` predicate to conditionally enable highlights only on injected languages. Another might be to toggle builtin queries via some buffer-local options, with a keybinding, or based on filename etc.\n\nI probably won't have time to work on this until ~June? so if someone else is eager to implement part 2 in the meantime they should go for it; otherwise, I can try to revisit once I'm settled in at my new home.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, I started an implementation with #32730 so that might be a useful starting point if someone else does want to work on this",
