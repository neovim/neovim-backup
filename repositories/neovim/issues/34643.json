    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe interactive part of the tutor plugin has some problems by design:\n- Interactive marks are in a separated `.json` file from the `.tutor` file. Which means if an user updates a tutor file, he has to update line numbers (could be many) in the `.json` file. That is a maintainance burden. And this is hard (or impossible) to automatically tested\n- If users delete a \"expect\" line and undo, or insert a line between 2 \"expect\" lines next to each other, interactive marks would become messy. This could be confusing to beginners\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9025, https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/15896\n\nUnfortunately I think it is not possible to fix the first one without breaking change, and the second one is also quite tricky, so I suggest removing that \"interactive\" part. I also find it unclear how those \"interactive\" marks actually help with learning Vim motion. Of course removing it is also a breaking change, but AFAIK, this tutor feature doesn't see much adoptions in plugins (in fact the only plugin I found is from the same author as the author of this Tutor plugin, but it also doesn't use interactive marks https://github.com/search?q=path%3A*.tutor+NOT+is%3Afork+NOT+owner%3Aneovim+NOT+owner%3Avim&type=code&ref=advsearch&p=3)\n\nFor the third problem, I can't think of a good solution right now, but I think it could be OK to just avoid using hyperlink in built-in tutor.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- Remove all Tutor's JSON files\n- Remove all code that create \"interactive\" marks in the tutor plugin\n- All lines where users practice could be marked with `--->`, like in `vimtutor` or [Helix tutor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/cb1ec1b27e9dad94e59ccbc6b9909956b768e4ec/runtime/tutor)\n- Remove all hyperlinks in built-in tutor files. Users could run `:Tutor <tutor-name>` instead\n- Not related, but as Bram suggested, when users open a tutor with `:Tutor`, should open a copy of the tutor file instead of the original one.\n\nA PR in Vim where related discussion is taking place https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/17600",

This was done this way to prevent the user from deleting or modifying the information about the interactive elements (otherwise, it would have to be provided inline in the file and it would have been more fragile, although there were some ways to alleviate the problem). I assumed tutor files would not be updated often, so I thought this was the right balance between maintainability and usability. \n- \"If users delete a \"expect\" line and undo, or insert a line between 2 \"expect\" lines next to each other, interactive marks would become messy. This could be confusing to beginners\". True, but if I remember correctly, this would not happen if the user followed the tutorial normally. There was always going to be a bit of fragility with the current method, and back then I had the plan to replace it with a virtual-text-based implementation, that (I think) would be more robust. This was before virtual text was included in neovim. I never got around to making this change (after the PhD, I've been full on working on academic stuff, so I haven't been active with neovim-related stuff).\n- On cursor movement: I had a version of the script that mapped navigation so that it would skip concealed elements, but I am not sure that was implemented in the neovim version (and was fragile).\n\nI think the interactive design of the tutor files is a nice display of neovim's capabilities, and should be kept (although it definitely needs to be updated).",
