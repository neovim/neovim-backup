    "body": "## Problem\n\n`b:undo_ftplugin` is a fragile and error-prone way to \"restore\" temporary filetype-local options, mappings, etc. It also requires extra boilerplate.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\n- Enhance `vim._with()` so that it provides a way for the \"restorable\" to be executed later.\n    - Idea: currently `vim._with()` returns a value. Instead, it could return a closure, which returns a value when executed.\n        - Callers that want to restore immediately can do this: `vim._with()()`.\n        - Callers (such as ftplugins) that want to restore later can do `local restore = vim._with()` and call `restore()` later.\n- Use `vim._with()` instead of `b:undo_ftplugin`.\n    - Only in Nvim-owned `ftplugin/*.lua`, initially...\n\n\n### Example\n\nHere's a random ftplugin example: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/6ef5dd5266822960d254b8acd5ab0934cc2b117e/runtime/ftplugin/8th.vim#L21-L27\n\nHere's what it would look like as Lua using `vim._with()`. Note:\n\n- the `b:undo_ftplugin` undo logic does not need to be manually specified. \n- \"append\" to `vim.o.matchpairs` is awkward. Blocked until https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20107 provides a way to \"append\" to `vim.o` and friends.\n\n```lua\nvim.b.undo_ftplugin = vim._with({ bo = {\n  ts=2, sts=2, sw=2, et=true,\n  com=[[s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,b:--,be:\\\\]],\n  fo='tcrqol',\n  matchpairs= vim.o.matchpairs .. [[\\::;]],\n  iskeyword='!,@,33-35,%,$,38-64,A-Z,91-96,a-z,123-126,128-255',\n  suffixesadd='.8th',\n} }, function()\nend)\n```",

Internally, `vim._with_c` https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/6ef5dd5266822960d254b8acd5ab0934cc2b117e/runtime/lua/vim/shared.lua#L1399 may use `context.c` , or shada. But in the Lua stdlib (and API), we only really need one interface. And internally, the interface is \"shada\".",

            "body": "The core idea of `vim._with()` is to execute code with temporarily set context. So like `nvim_buf_call`, `nvim_win_call`, etc.\n\nI don't think it is a valid replacement for the `b:undo_ftplugin` because it fundamentally limits (to what `vim._with` supports as a context) of what ftplugin can set and later unset. As was mentioned in previous comment, it currently doesn't support Vimscript variables, Lua global variables, and probably won't support something like buffer-local mappings.\n\n---\n\nAlso, here is the comparison of the current and proposed here `vim._with` approaches for the common case of ftplugins setting buffer-local options:\n\n```lua\n-- Current\nvim.bo.comments, vim.bo.commentstring = 'b:#', '# %s'\nvim.b.undo_ftplugin = 'setl com< cms<'\n\n-- With `_with`\nlocal context = { bo = { comments = 'b:#', commentstring = '# %s' } }\nvim.b.undo_ftplugin = vim._with(context, function() end)\n```\n\nThe current approach uses more common syntax (easier to maintain in long term) but requires manual tracking of what to restore. The `vim._with` approaches feels like inventing a DSL specifically for ftplugins, but there is automatic tracking of restored context.\n\nAll in all, a more direct and feature-rich solution to #18238 would indeed be to \"simply\" allow `vim.b.undo_ftplugin` to be Lua function. Then users can do significantly more with it, while still being kind of forced to use current Vimscript-like approach for common cases.\n\nThe ideal approach for `undo_ftplugin` is probably to:\n\n- Somehow track the buffer-local \"context\" automatically before sourcing any ftplugin.\n- Figure out the difference after ftplugin is sourced.\n- Automatically restore only the changed context values when now `undo_ftplugin` takes effect.\n\n",
