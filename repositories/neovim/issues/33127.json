It worked fine in previous versions.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun `nvim --clean <somefile>`\nMove to the somewhere in the file\nSwitch to another iTerm2 window or tab\nSwitch back to the neovim instance.\nPress `j` or `k` and observe the cursor jumping to the bottom or top respectively\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShould move only one line\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0 Build type: Release LuaJIT 2.1.1741730670\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.3.2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niTerm2 3.5.11\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew",

However, even if it is iTerms fault, what you're suggesting is letting the nvim 0.11 users on the Mac hang out to dry: iTerm2 is insanely popular so you can expect that many (probably most) of the Mac users are going to face this and potentially other issues until iTerm2 can cut a new release **and** users have upgraded. There's a good chance this project will see a number of duplicate reports, too, causing unnecessary additional load for the nvim project. If there's a workaround or even just a way to detect the problem and put out a warning, that would make a ton of sense to me.",
