However, I've noticed that it fails to detect some filetypes when no buffer is specified.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI expected a file with the \".ts\" extension to be detected as TypeScript, but in fact, it might be detected as XML depending on the buffer content.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/4ffc20c9515294481486e81271a8edeeff203140/runtime/lua/vim/filetype.lua#L1031\r\n\r\nIn this case, when no `bur` is specified, the getting of buffer contents fails, and the filetype is not detected.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.filetype.match({ filename = 'index.ts', contents = {} }) -- => nil\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/4ffc20c9515294481486e81271a8edeeff203140/runtime/lua/vim/filetype.lua#L2208-L2216\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen no `buf` is specified, it is better to assume an empty buffer (or a buffer of `contents`) is passed and detect the filetype.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-2244+g8bc578512\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nLinux 6.1.67-gentoo x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",

In particular I know I do want an API that gets better results when a buffer is open containing the source file, but I also want an API that operates without that, for cases where a user directly wants to open a test file (without getting too far in the weeds on the workflow specifics). But in order to decide on language-specific behavior for where test files live, it was useful to use `vim.filetype.match` to get a filetype from the source file path, and the current behavior means I get to implement effectively what was described above about scratch buffers manually instead of e.g. reading in the contents of the source path and passing those along for the match.\n\n(I'm not saying that in my opinion that means this justifies the complexity to support, just sharing my use case for taking into the equation).",
