There could be kitty-client in a separate repo that could display images. For that it must be able to ask nvim where there are actually images (and meta data like size etc.). This could implemented by nvim lua module that places extmarks at ranges where images can be displayed. The kitty client can just ask the lua module for the images and then output the escape codes. This way there would be virtually no code in the main repo and each client can implement the rendering of the meta data their way.",

The next step would then be \"extended language injection\" to allow applying this to specific regions of a buffer.",

Caveats are (to my research) that it is also the by far most complex image protocol available.\r\n\r\nBefore going to \"just implement\" one image protocol, I think we've to admit there is some fragmentation and it would make sense to whatever image protocol is going to be supported by (Neo)?vim it should probably made in a more abstract way to support not just one image protocol (NB: there's great work from @csdvrx to display pixmaps via a [unicode rasterizer](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/448#issuecomment-744192801), a great way to work around non-supporting terminals).\r\n\r\nThere is (or was) quite some heat discussions on a future image protocol in the terminal-wg forum however, that I think is worth keeping an eye on: [12](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/12) and [16](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/26).\r\n\r\np.s.: I'd love to see that happening in a somewhat terminal-independant manner at *some* point so that when I'm editing latex, my latex plugin can render math formulas in little popup windows :D",
