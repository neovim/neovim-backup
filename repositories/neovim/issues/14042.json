Note that this repository implements configuration and initialization of language servers. Implementation of the language server spec itself is located in the neovim core repository-->\r\n\r\n- `nvim --version`: NVIM v0.5.0-dev+1115-gc1fbc2ddf\r\n- What language server (If the problem is related to a specific language server): Omnisharp\r\n- Can you reproduce this behavior on other language server clients (vscode, languageclient-neovim, coc.nvim, etc.): It works in vscode\r\n- Is the problem isolated to a particular language server: Not sure\r\n- Operating system/version: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce the problem from neovim startup\r\n- Create a new Unity project\r\n- Open the project in Neovim\r\n- Add or rename a file from Neovim\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nIntellisense and completion is broken when creating or renaming files with Omnisharp (only in the new file) in the Unity project. For example, LSP won't recognise the \"using UnityEngine\" statement.\r\n\r\nIt will still work in other files in the project, but the LSP client won't recognise the new class added. The only way to fix this is to restart the language server.\r\nI'm not sure is this bug is related to Unity or omnisharp, but it works fine in VS Code.\r\n\r\nNote that in the case of a small dotnet CLI project, it seems to work.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nIntellisense and completion should continue to work when creating or renaming files with Omnisharp. \r\n### Minimal init.vim or init.lua and code sample\r\nMy config looks like this : \r\n\r\n```lua\r\nnvim_lsp.omnisharp.setup {\r\n    cmd = {omnisharp_bin, \"--languageserver\", \"--hostPID\", tostring(pid)},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

If you rename the class, the language server will also rename the file - because In Java top level class name and file name must match.\r\n\r\nThese functions can otherwise not be used directly by users, but are only there in case the language server wants to make changes to files. `rename` is one example. Code actions could be another case where a language server may use them.\r\n",
