I can/will just include this in my plugin source for now, but:\r\n\r\nI'm wondering, is this something we want to upstream? The structured version of this data could be used to generate the `:help` file, and programmatic access to this data would be useful for plugin authors. For example, it could be used to implement a clone of Emacs's `<C-h>k`. If so, does the core team have thoughts about where it should go?",

Instead we want to encode this knowledge in `runtime/lua/vim/_meta/*.lua`. See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19918\r\n\r\n",

The \"source of truth\" is `src/nvim/eval.lua` and `src/nvim/options.lua`\r\n2. Those are used to generate _both_ help files and runtime files (`runtime/lua/vim/_meta/*.lua`).\r\n3. Future \"ideal\" state is that `_meta/*.lua` becomes the source of truth, but that's not urgent.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\n1. Your JSON file could be used to bootstrap `src/nvim/normal.lua` (analogous to `eval.lua`/`options.lua` above).\r\n2. Use that to generate `index.txt`.\r\n3. Also generate `_meta/normal.lua` file. (Like _not_ an \"annotations\" file, beause normal-mode commands don't have any representation as Lua functions...).",
