    "body": "### Problem\n\nRight now the [gF](https://neovim.io/doc/user/editing.html#gF) feature seems to only support a limited set of patterns. In particular, it doesn't seem to work with python's backtrace format:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/path/to/file.py\", line 123, in <module>\n```\n\nIt also seems to completely ignore column info since gF on `file:123:12:` (eg as emitted by modern gcc and clang) seeks to the 123rd line but not the 12th column.\n\nOne of the things I miss most from vscode is that I can run a command in the terminal and just cmd-click in the output when it is referring to a file and go right where I need to go. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe vscode terminal's logic to detect file/line/column seems to work fairly well in practice, so it may be a good source of inspiration. It looks like [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/ce2c2f3c79a32b9917e32c61e058392dc5a1b6aa/src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminalContrib/links/browser/terminalLinkParsing.ts#L64-L126) is list of 3 regexes that they use, along with examples patterns that they are trying to match.\n\nOnce you have the parser able to recognize columns, it would be nice if `gF` automatically went to the right column as well.\n\nMaybe this should be a new ticket, but it would be really nice if the built-in `:terminal` was automatically enhanced to recognize these patterns and A) apply a highlight group, possibly only when the cursor or mouse is over one (bonus points if the highlight group was only applied when the file exists!), and B) consider a default mapping on `<LeftMouse>` or `<C-LeftMouse>` to go to the file.\n\nAnother nice feature would be something to send the matching locations to the quickfix list. I have tried `:cgetbuffer` from the terminal and it does not work well, at least with the default `errorformat`. Among other issues, I wasn't able to make one that would match file:line:column in the middle of a line and not treat anything before the file as part of the message rather than the file. It would be especially cool if there was support for only sending the output from the last command to quickfix using OSC codes from the prompt to delimit command boundaries (at least kitty and vscode support the [OSC 133](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Per_Bothner/specifications/blob/master/proposals/semantic-prompts.md) A/B/C/D sequence for this which is also useful for #9209). This would let you run your build in a terminal and still get all the niceties like live progress reporting and colorful output, while still being able to use the quickfix list as if you used `:make`",
