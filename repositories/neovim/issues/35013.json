However, I think this compromise works:\n\n1. by default, show all lines up to the fictional 'messageheight' (currently hardcoded)\n    - if there are still truncated lines, add a `[+n]` at the end\n2. when that msg area disappears on user input (`on_key` handler), shrink to 'cmdheight' with `[+n]`.\n\nUpdated the \"Phase 1\" spec in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/34281 to reflect the above.",
