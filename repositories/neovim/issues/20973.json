This is obviously subjective and individuals could enable/disable those borders as desired, as well as customize them.\r\n\r\n2- Identification of currently active window\r\nAlthough there are workarounds for this, I think a lot of them are sub-optimal (e.g.: using winhighlight to change the appearance within the active window, using cursorcolumn, relying on statusline, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is a workflow similar to tiling managers like i3 and be able to identify the currently active window by setting a border around all 4 sides of that window. Example:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7985687/200184838-d1bbc11c-f76e-4fd6-9684-2c43c946fe7d.png)\r\n\r\nWhile Neovim currently has a concept of separator, it still lacks the required flexibility since it is controlled only by the window to the left and is only meant for separation, not identification. Even if you change the highlight of the separator, you still end up in situations where you have 2 windows, and the appearance of the separator is not an intuitive visual cue of the active one:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7985687/200184390-61a33904-12c8-4b94-aa39-cfc0f68f7bd0.png)\r\n\r\nWith each window having its own border, you could only show the border for the currently active window like so:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7985687/200184531-84894a84-2c44-4efc-af46-a69e666b5259.png)\r\n(Please excuse my terrible image editing skills, end result would obviously look much better)\r\n\r\n\r\n3- Added visual information\r\nAnother use case could be to add quick visual information between windows. For example, you could have different borders or color of borders depending on characteristics of the underlying buffer (e.g.: plugin authors could have different window border on uncomitted git files or unsaved files, etc.)\r\n\r\n",
