I.e.:\n\n- `:terminal`: enter insert (\"terminal\") mode\n- `:terminal ls`: stay in normal mode\n\nIt seems like currently the only way to do this is to extract that information from the amatch / afile: not ideal.\n\nMy use case is running a compiler in watch mode (`:hor terminal typst watch %`) and immediately switching back to the previous window. This would currently require pressing `<C-\\><C-n><C-w>w` instead of `<C-w>w` if one has 'startinsert' enabled for terminal buffers.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe simplest solution would be to have a `data.cmd` field in the `TermOpen` autocmd event and then something like:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('TermOpen', function(ev) \n  if not ev.data.cmd then\n    vim.cmd.startinsert()\n  end\nend)\n```\n\n(Drawback: Not available in Vimscript?)",

Enhancing `TermClose` would get us closer to removing the dumb `[Process exited 1]` message, too.\n\n> (Drawback: Not available in Vimscript?)\n\nWith https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/35793 , any event that uses `aucmd_defer` will automatically copy `data` to `v:event`, so the same fields will be available in both. For events that cannot use `aucmd_defer`, I wouldn't worry about it.",
