But yes it still isn't, and I think it doesn't need to be (mainly to allow us to avoid the window from altering the layout of other windows, one of the advantages the message grid was originally added for).\n\nNow I understand the design choice. Thanks for the explanation!\n\nOne of the reasons that I suggest using split window for messages is that I compare the new message window with the existing and established cmdwin, quickfix window, and preview window -- they are all small split windows used to show some special contents, so I think maybe it will be nice to maintain some consistency for the messages window, or at least allow some customization option to open the message window in a split.\n\nAnother benefit of using a split window for messages is that users can see other split windows while keeping the messages visible and conveniently refer to them, without having the messages window overlap with part of normal split windows.\n\n> avoid the window from altering the layout\n\nJust a proposal, maybe we can set `splitkeep` to `screen` or `topline` before opening the split messages window and restore it after opening the window to avoid resizing existing windows? Although I still prefer default behavior (`cursor`) because I don't want my cursor position in other windows to change.\n\nI can see both methods (floating window vs split window) have their own strengths and drawbacks. It would be great to automatically close the floating messages window on leave, but it would even be greater if we could add a config option to allow user to choose their preferred method.",
