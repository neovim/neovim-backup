But in practice it might be a breaking change for some UI, especially since the documentation says this:\r\n> Indicates to the UI that it must stop rendering the cursor. This event is misnamed and does not actually have anything to do with busyness.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking about a potential hack that we could use in Neovide, which allows `cursor_goto` during the busy periods. It's not elegant, but has the advantage that it handles other types of busy periods as well, and there's a smaller chance of something going wrong.  But I think it's certainly better than our [current hack](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/753), which causes some bugs on its own, and would therefore like to be able to remove when Neovim 0.11 is released.\r\n\r\n* If a `grid_cursor_goto` is received during a UI batch where the cursor is disabled, set `desired_cursor_target` to that position, but don't update the actual (hidden) cursor position\r\n* When `nvim_busy_end` is received animated from the current cursor position, the one before `ui_busy_start` was called to `desired_cursor_target`",
