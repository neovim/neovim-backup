One of the main use-cases of a dynamic `cmd()` is to be able to start a new server  whose binary may be located *in the workspace* ([example](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3912)).\n\nFor reference, `reuse_client` is already passed the resolved config.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nPass the resolved config to `cmd(..., config)` here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/e74753a221f82b2c7bade8c079683c19252484fe/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/client.lua#L457-L458\n\nUnlike https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33615 which changes the return type, sending an extra arg to the callback is a lower-cost change.",

The arguments in favor of making this change are (correct me if wrong):\n\n- the [change](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34550)\n    - is tiny,\n    - follows the precedent of `reuse_client` (thus closing a UX gap),\n    - and can be delivered sooner than [\"fully dynamic config()\"](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32287#issuecomment-2835155023)\n- \"fully dynamic config()\" is a *last resort*, not something we want to encourage, because:\n    - it removes any opportunity to (at least partially) statically inspect the config\n        - makes `vim.inspect()` less useful\n        - defeats caching\n        - etc?\n    - conversely, if we *don't* want to discourage \"fully dynamic config()\", then that implies we should deprecate most of the existing function/callback fields. right?",
