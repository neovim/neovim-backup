I can use `go-to-definition` provided by LuaLS, but it is slow and sometime doesn't work at all\n\nBut since Lua is always builtin in Neovim, I think it makes sense to make it possible to go to other module in `package.path` and `rtp`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`gf` should be able to go to module in `package.path` and `rtp`. Possible implementation here https://github.com/brianhuster/dotfiles/blob/main/nvim/lua/an/lua.lua#L32. I can send a PR",
