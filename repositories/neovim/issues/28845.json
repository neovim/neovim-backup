There is no way to fix/update the deprecated functions until the plugin maintainer updates their upstream. So, this leaves me having to keep dealing with deprecation warnings popups.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`nvim` should support a flag `--suppress-deprecation-warnings` to ignore the deprecation warnings",

If you find it's annoying and interferes with your workflow, you should stick to a stable release (0.10) version instead of HEAD/nightly versions. Warnings are actually useful, although it may seem a bit inconvenient for end users, because with the \"hard deprecation\" warnings plugin authors are strongly encouraged to fix the deprecated API as soon as possible while in the development cycle and before the full release.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort, you may want to monkey-patch those deprecated Lua functions (e.g. `vim.tbl_islist = vim.islist`), or even `vim.deprecate` to suppress all warnings, in your config or via command line arguments to `nvim`.",
