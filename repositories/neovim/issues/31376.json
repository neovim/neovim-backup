Users and plugin authors get exhausted by deprecation frequency.\n2. Core devs get exhausted by the API \"maturation\" cycle (including \"bikeshedding\" and other discussions to avoid hard-to-reverse mistakes), \n3. And *conversely*, core devs also get exhausted by\n    1. the deprecation phases, and/or\n    2. maintenance of old but disfavored APIs.\n\n\n# Expected behavior\n\nWe can actually have it both ways, roughly outlined here: https://sink.io/jmk/neovimconf-2024/#future-deprecation-strategy\n\n## Define \"experiment\" phase\n\nWe have \"experimental\" stuff but it's not clear what that means.\n\n## Introduce a new deprecation phase: \"frozen\"\n\nFrozen interfaces continue to be backwards-compatible at an \"ABI\" level (i.e. programmatic consumers won't break), but their docs and implementation are shuffled to a remote location, safely protecting innocent villagers from their ionizing radiation. \n\n1. move its implementation to `_deprecated.lua`\n2. its programmatic interface (\"ABI\" compatibility) continues to work\n3. delete its docs; it also should not auto-complete by `:lua vim.xx.<tab>`\n4. mention it in `:help deprecated`\n5. it is \"frozen\" and unsupported, though programmatic consumers can continue to use it without worrying about hard-breakage\n    - bug reports involving a frozen API get rejected.\n    - we will keep the old tests in `test/.../deprecated_spec.lua` and that's it. no other support.\n\nThis allows us to minimize the API (not ABI) much more aggressively, without breaking anyone.\n\nIt still leaves the door open for \"full removal\" as a later step, but completely avoids debates about whether it is \"worth it\" to make these kinds of interface-simplifications. And that is exactly the case for `start_client`. We can clear away all of its redundant docs and explanations, without breaking downstream.\n\n## Open questions\n\n- Do we accept PRs for fixing bugs for these, even if they are very small?\n\n- What should be done with vim.deprecate? Should warnings still be printed to command line? Should functions be listed in deprecated checkhealth?\n\n## Closed questions\n\n- tbd\n\n## Outcomes\n\n1. Doing a \"breaking change\" pr and shepherding it through, advocating for it, etc is exhausting. It's much easier to do that as 1 batch where a bunch of already-frozen APIs get full-removed in 1 PR.\n\n## Todo\n\n1. document `:help stdlib-contract` , `:help stdlib-frozen`\n    - Q: what if a bug is reported on a frozen API? (A: rejected)",

So I am going to suggest my experience. First of all, it's pretty similar to yours and the path you've chosen actually works in production for quite a long time.\n\nIn Kotlin programming language there are 3 deprecation cycles:\n\n- Warning\n- Error\n- Hidden\n\nIf it's a warning, you can continue use it. If it's an error, you still can use it if you wrap it around with some structure like @Suppress(\"...\"). But if it's hidden, it's a whole different story. Program that uses Deprecation(HIDDEN) will never compile with such declarations. IDE and LSP do not suggest you these. Yet if they met at runtime, you got the binary compatibility. That's very convenient to library developers in our ecosystem. [You can read more there.](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/deprecation)\n\nObviously Lua is not going to be compiled and there is not way to prevent actually accessing such APIs. But removing documentation is just as good. I think you are getting in the right way with your thoughts.",
