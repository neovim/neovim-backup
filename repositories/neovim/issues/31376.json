Users and plugin authors get exhausted by deprecation frequency.\n2. Core devs get exhausted by the API \"maturation\" cycle (including \"bikeshedding\" and other discussions to avoid hard-to-reverse mistakes), \n3. And *conversely*, core devs also get exhausted by\n    1. the deprecation phases, and/or\n    2. maintenance of old but disfavored APIs.\n\n\n# Expected behavior\n\nWe can actually have it both ways, roughly outlined here: https://sink.io/jmk/neovimconf-2024/#future-deprecation-strategy\n\n## Define \"experiment\" phase\n\nWe have \"experimental\" stuff but it's not clear what that means.\n\n## Introduce a new deprecation phase: \"frozen\"\n\nFrozen interfaces continue to be backwards-compatible at an \"ABI\" level (i.e. programmatic consumers won't break), but their docs and implementation are shuffled to a remote location, safely protecting innocent villagers from their ionizing radiation. \n\n1. move its implementation to `_deprecated.lua`\n2. its programmatic interface (\"ABI\" compatibility) continues to work\n3. delete its docs; it also should not auto-complete by `:lua vim.xx.<tab>`\n4. mention it in `:help deprecated`\n5. it is \"frozen\" and unsupported, though programmatic consumers can continue to use it without worrying about hard-breakage\n    - bug reports involving a frozen API get rejected.\n    - we will keep the old tests in `test/.../deprecated_spec.lua` and that's it. no other support.\n\nThis allows us to minimize the API (not ABI) much more aggressively, without breaking anyone.\n\nIt still leaves the door open for \"full removal\" as a later step, but completely avoids debates about whether it is \"worth it\" to make these kinds of interface-simplifications. And that is exactly the case for `start_client`. We can clear away all of its redundant docs and explanations, without breaking downstream.\n\n## Open questions\n\n- Do we accept PRs for fixing bugs for these, even if they are very small?\n\n- What should be done with vim.deprecate? Should warnings still be printed to command line? Should functions be listed in deprecated checkhealth?\n\n## Closed questions\n\n- tbd\n\n## Outcomes\n\n1. Doing a \"breaking change\" pr and shepherding it through, advocating for it, etc is exhausting. It's much easier to do that as 1 batch where a bunch of already-frozen APIs get full-removed in 1 PR.\n\n## Todo\n\n1. document `:help stdlib-contract` , `:help stdlib-frozen`\n    - Q: what if a bug is reported on a frozen API? (A: rejected)",
