And yes, I've remapped j and k to gj and gk, but yet all the other nice ways to scroll and navigate through text remain absolutely unusable (c-e, c-y, mouse wheel scroll, c-d, c-u...).

Many of them tried hard to get into it but end up getting really frustrated by its scrolling behavior and then give up.\r\n\r\n**Can we please add an option that makes vim consider equal the soft wrapped (visual) lines and the hard wrapped lines?

I don't think so.\r\nMaybe this is just not as important/urgent to the majority as it is to you or maybe it is just much harder to do than you think and people refrain from tackling it.\r\n\r\nI guess the fasted way to get this would be to be pro-active and attempt a pull-request yourself.\r\nIf this is out of the question, as far as I am concerned, you have done all you can do for now to make your point.\r\n\r\n---\r\n***edit:***\r\n\r\n@GianniGi: It seems you misinterpreted my comment about the upvotes as an offense. I'm sorry to see that. I honestly meant to answer your question by pointing out that more than 1000 people saw your post but most 'support' it got came from you. So probably there is nothing more you can do. I did not intend to say you are wrong with this issue or clicking the icons. It's just that from my point of view, all you suggested has been around before. So other than compiling all the information and raising some attention to it, the only thing you could do would be providing a solution yourself.\r\n\r\nBy posting in this issue every few days without any new information (just to 'bump' the issue) I think it is more likely that repository watchers unsubscribe from this particular issue than someone coming up with a simple solution he/she didn't come up 4 days before. :wink:\r\n\r\nSo the intention of this post was not to offend you but to show that people read your messages, take them serious and not getting your feature in a short amount of time is not a sign for nobody caring.\r\n\r\nAlso, less than 400 people have so far contributed code to Neovim but you reached more than a thousand with this issue. I justed wanted you to consider that lack of reach might not be the thing that is blocking this feature.\r\n",

Perhaps the ideas could be applied for this as well.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11014 and this thread's discussions I understood that one of the reasons why row-wise scrolling is hard is due to Neovim's internal data structures not being primed for this use-case (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11014#issuecomment-536761143). It looks like the implementation of https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11014 @ 7d333c6d297bf03b2cde77d4c54294bd587572d1 requires recomputing physical lines up to the cursor position and that would be slow for long lines.\r\n\r\nWhat I've been thinking about revolves around computing displayed physical lines' bounds based on the amount of skipped **line buffer characters** from the top line (which is not `w_skipcol` since `w_skipcol` also counts virtual characters such as `showbreak`). Starting from that offset we'd continuously slice line fragments until the whole available text area for the current screen is filled, therefore knowing the displayed physical lines' bounds. Having this data could allow for a crude manner of userland row-wise scrolling, e.g. to scroll down (assumes `set scrolloff=0`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf on the bottom physical line:\r\n  Input \"gj\"\r\nOtherwise:\r\n  Save cursor position\r\n  Go to the bottom physical line\r\n  Input \"gj\", therefore making the window scroll\r\n  Restore the cursor position\r\n    Note: + 1 line if it cursor was at the top physical line, since it was scrolled off the screen\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, since the bottom physical line's bounds would be known, it should be possible to infer the next one's bounds without scrolling the screen.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if I'm missing or misunderstanding something which would make this idea unreasonable.",

If you were to input \"gj\" on the last row of a line that filled the whole screen, the entire line is scrolled off screen (and likewise with scrolling up). I'm not sure how you'd get a usable row-wise scrolling just from userspace modifications, but it'd be nice to be proven wrong! Or maybe for your use case the jumpiness doesn't matter?\r\n\r\nAccording to the last comment I made on the pull request, this is apparently not too far from being mergeable as an experimental feature. I haven't had much time for open source work in a while, but maybe I can brush that code off sometime soon.",

If you were to input \"gj\" on the last row of a line that filled the whole screen, the entire line is scrolled off screen (and likewise with scrolling up).\r\n\r\nI was considering \"row-wise scrolling\" merely as the capability of shifting the text in terms of physical lines, without regards for how it was presented. I wasn't taking into consideration much of what you said there when it comes to look and feel, so apologies.\r\n\r\n> Or maybe for your use case the jumpiness doesn't matter?\r\n\r\nYes, it wouldn't matter for me. What I described there is more like \"text scrolling in terms of physical lines\" rather than the \"row-wise scrolling\" being envisioned for that feature as I perceive it now.\r\n\r\n> According to the last comment I made on the pull request, this is apparently not too far from being mergeable as an experimental feature. I haven't had much time for open source work in a while, but maybe I can brush that code off sometime soon.\r\n\r\nI saw one of your mentions about how bothersome it is to grapple with some of the options. It definitely feels that way even from an outsider's perspective, but I hope it's not bad enough to discourage you from pursuing the idea. Best of luck with your PR. :-)",
