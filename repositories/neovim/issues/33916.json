    "body": "### Problem\n\nHey,\n\nI'm wondering if it would be a good idea to standardize an interface for window selection?\nJust about every other plugin rolls up their own version, resulting in an inconsistent (and sometimes buggy) experience.\n\nFor example, I use [window-picker](https://github.com/s1n7ax/nvim-window-picker) for my own mappings, neotree uses [its own thing](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/blob/main/lua/neo-tree/ui/selector.lua), neotest uses [yet another thing](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest/blob/master/lua/neotest/lib/ui/init.lua#L38), and there are probably others somewhere in mini-ui, all of their UIs are different, and they use different markers (lowercase, uppercase, numbers). Telescope also exposes a separate [customization point](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/blob/a4ed82509cecc56df1c7138920a1aeaf246c0ac5/lua/telescope/config.lua#L841-L853) for this.\n\nSomething similar might potentially make sense for buffers, although there telescope provides a common enough solution.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI think it would be nice to have a simple interface defined and allow for customization, such as with vim.ui.select.\nThe default implementation can just call vim.ui.select with tabnr and bufname in each line. The API would look something like this (just a suggestion):\n```lua\nvim.ui.select_window(opts, callback)\n-- where\nopts = {\n    tab = 0, -- or -1 for all tabs; callback would have to get {tab = x, winnr = y} if multi-tab\n    prompt = 'Select window',\n    -- other fields allowed for plugins to consume\n}\n```\n\nThen users can just use their plugin of choice, and plugin authors wouldn't have to implement this thing every time.",
