No need of `au!` either, because a submode could not be\r\nredefined (`submode!` would clear everything inside the previously defined\r\nsubmode). Also commands wouldn't need `!` for the same reason.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou would enable it with:\r\n\r\n    submodestart(<name>[, <scope>])\r\n\r\nwhere `<scope>` would be global by default, or it can be `buffer` or `window`.\r\n\r\nYou would end it with:\r\n\r\n    submodeend(<name>[, <scope>])\r\n\r\nA mode that is enabled for a scope, would need to be disabled for that scope:\r\n\r\n    call submodestart('mysubmode', 'buffer')\r\n    call submodeend('mysubmode')                \" ERROR: no global submode 'mysubmode'\r\n    call submodeend('mysubmode', 'window')      \" ERROR: no window submode 'mysubmode'\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDifferent submodes could be enabled at the same time in the same context, then\r\nif two submodes define conflicting commands/mappings, the last one would win.\r\n\r\nTo make them stackable, each window/buffer would have a list of enabled\r\nsubmodes, plus there would be a global list for the globally enabled submodes.\r\nEach submode that is enabled in the current context is checked for a matching\r\ncommand/mapping/autocommand. Submodes would be checked in reverse order, so the\r\nlast enabled submode would be checked first.\r\n",
