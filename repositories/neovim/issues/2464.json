It seems like today the server assumes the client has one big window/canvas and it tells what text to put where. This is not ideal if we want to create native windows. For e.g., let's say we have neovim.app (GUI for OSX) and user creates a vertical split to show the navigation tree on the left side. Today, the window edges are created using symbols like \"|\" because that's what the server is sending. Correct me if I am wrong. If we want to draw the window border ourselves using OSX frames, then we really need to know the text to place inside each window.\n\nHere is the reference issue I had raised in neovim.app: https://github.com/rogual/neovim-dot-app/issues/73\n",
