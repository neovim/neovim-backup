That issue appears to address a consistent general interface for rendering images in Neovim's normal buffer, as seen in plugins like [image.nvim](https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim) or [hologram.nvim](https://github.com/edluffy/hologram.nvim). However, in the context of a terminal buffer (e.g., VT220/xterm terminal emulator), it seems that additional work is required to enhance it into a graphic protocol-compatible terminal emulator. This would allow commands like kitten icat en.png to render images properly.",
