This results in an empty hover floating window, hiding the valid content provided by the first server.\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim --clean -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\n\n1. Configure two LSP servers for the same buffer (e.g., a custom test LSP and `jsonls`).  \n2. Make the first LSP return any hover content in its `onHover` handler.  \n3. Trigger hover (`K`) on a JSON file.  \n4. Observe that `jsonls` returns an empty hover response, which overwrites the previous non-empty hover content.  \n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- Hover content from one LSP should not be overwritten by an empty response from another.  \n- Ideally, Neovim should either:  \n  - Merge hover responses from multiple LSPs, or  \n  - Ignore empty responses and preserve the non-empty hover content.  \n\nI think MERGE is a good idea.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-1691+g7e09fedf43 Build type: RelWithDebInfo LuaJIT 2.1.1763318511 Run \"nvim -V1 -v\" for more inf\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nnot important\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nubuntu 24\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
