    "body": "> With vertical conceal, it should make it possible to completely re-implement folding with either/all:\n> - Re-implementing `fold.c` to use the marktree. This would be a fantastic refactor, similar to what we did with signs.\n>   - Every fold is just an extmark and to open or fold these marks is just a case of setting the conceal_lines flag.\n>   - Would allow us to remove many `hadFolding()` calls scattered across the codebase.\n> - Would allow plugins to implement their own folding using the same method as above. They store all their marks in a namespace and just flip the conceal flag to open and close a fold.\n>   - Would be potentially easier to implement than a custom `foldexpr` since marks track buffer changes automatically.\n> - Allow column based folding (finally), since we can conceal parts of a line.\n> - Custom foldtext can be implemented with normal extmarks.\n> \n> @luukvbaal thoughts? Do you think there's a path here? \n\n _Originally posted by @lewis6991 in [#25718](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25718#issuecomment-2538418269)_",
