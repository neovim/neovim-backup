    "body": "### Problem\n\nHello, I'm the author of [matchparen.nvim](https://github.com/monkoose/matchparen.nvim) plugin.\nAt the time of the creation I was wondered maybe core team would fix default matchparen by themself, but it never happens. So I'm interested is there a willing to replace it? And recently some user asked why my plugin isn't default. So here am I\n\nWhy does it matter?\n- default plugin is slower (can drastically slowdown scrolling in big files with long lines)\n- it doesn't respect treesitter, so it often highlights wrong parentheses.\n- Had (maybe still have) some highlighting issues\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhy to adopt matchparen.nvim?\n- Small enough, almost drop-in replacement of the default one, not a behemoth like matchup plugin\n- battle tested (4 years in existence).\n- general enough (doesn't require custom queries and works for all buffers (treesitter/regex syntax)). And doesn't require to maintain them.\n- It is faster and also have debounce option.\n\nWhat would require for adoptation\n- autoload without setup() function\n- change how config is provided\n- maybe adding treesitter queries (because they are faster than linear search (doesn't matter in most cases, can fix issues like https://github.com/monkoose/matchparen.nvim/issues/15)",
