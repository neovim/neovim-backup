Improve the `commands` interface and/or provide util functions so that defining commands/aliases to call custom (off-spec) server commands requires 2x less code.\n\n## Questions\n\n- `vim.lsp.get_active_clients()[1].server_capabilities` and `vim.lsp.get_active_clients()[1].commands` already exist. What is the remaining friction? Why do we get requests like [this](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1921)? Do we simply need some hints in the documentation that guide users? Do we need a util function that makes it easy for users to define mappings around server commands/capabilities?\n    - Answer: see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28329#issuecomment-2054151019\n\n## Possible interface\n\nFrom https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/1937#issuecomment-1481033025 (the names don't matter right now, they are just pseudo-code; the point is that we need a generic interface for (1) iterating custom shit from the LSP server and (2) enabling users to create their own mappings to this stuff): \n\n> some sort of \"sub-command\" entrypoint so that langserver-specific commands can be discovered.

These are advertised within server_capabilities.executeCommandProvider.commands and they (usually) work without any special client logic. The workflow is usually something like:\r\n    - user triggers code actions\r\n    - user selects code action to execute\r\n    - client tells server to run the command\r\n    - server sends workspaceEdit to the client\r\n\r\n  We cannot provide a generic way for users to call these commands directly, because many of them require arguments or context (e.g given via the code actions). The arguments required are command specific\r\n\r\n- _client_ commands. The specification doesn't specify any concrete client commands, but it acknowledges that clients can implement custom client commands. These are _not_ advertised by the server in `server_capabilities`. Typically the client informs the server that it supports them via `settings` or `init_options` in the initialize request. These always require some sort of custom client logic, and there's no way to have a general mechanism to use them. \r\n\r\n\r\n> The current situation with nvim-lspconfig is that 10+ lines of code are needed to define each command or custom capability.

            "body": "@justinmk other lsp clients, such as coc or vscode, use something similar to a command palette (other ides also have similar interfaces which group actions in an easily filterable/discoverable pick-list). What i suggest is we provide a way (e.g. an interface for attaching commands, and another interface on top of ui.select for the actual ui presentation) for other plugins (such as for example nvim-jdtls @mfussenegger, which has quite a few user commands exposing some of the internal offspec jdtls capabilities) to easily attach their own custom commands, instead of creating UserCommands as they do atm. It should look/feel similar, and it is pretty much an analogue to code_actions. \r\n\r\nHere is how coc nvim exposes all the commands that the different extensions register. For nvim those should maybe be filtered by filetype, currently active clients etc etc, but this is the general idea. If we provide this, it will be easy for plugin users to discover custom commands that the lsp extension plugins expose and they will not need to learn new user commands, if they can fuzzy search them or their description. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/15955811/d6e6a87d-3e48-4aa7-be3d-3c5fa1e53bb6)\r\n\r\nThere are others, which have a well defined behavior, which we can expose/add from nvim too, eventually, such as workspace related actions - displaying currently attached workspace folders, or inspecting workspace edits and so on.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/15955811/b2999430-f9f1-4795-9a7c-7f3fa24a3767)\r\n",

It's just a extra LSP method. There is no discovery mechanism for these. Just the documentation of the language server - or in many cases not even that, but reverse engineering of vscode extensions.\r\n\r\nThe main problems here are:\r\n\r\n- You need to know the arguments required, and logic to create them.\r\n- You need to know the response type\r\n- You need custom logic to process the response. \r\n\r\nThis is all specific to the method.\r\n\r\nAnd the `open_docs` example is also kinda broken, it should use `client.request` like the `reload_workspace` example. `vim.lsp.buf_request` would make a request using all clients attached to a buffer, which means other servers not supporting it would receive the request too, and very likely fail.\r\n\r\nClient commands on the other hand can be used instead of server commands, and are part of some other operations like code-actions. The difference to server commands is that they usually have more round-trips.\r\n\r\nFor example nvim-jdtls defines a `java.action.generateToStringPrompt` command (using `vim.lsp.commands`, which is documented), and advertises it in the settings of the initiailize request. The workflow is then like this:\r\n\r\n- User triggers code action\r\n- Server responds with available code actions, including an additional \"Generate toString\" action\r\n- User selects \"Generate toString\", this triggers the client command\r\n- Client command sends custom request to server (`java/checkToStringStatus`), server responds with the properties that can be included in a `toString` implementation.\r\n- Client shows a prompt to the user to select the properties to use\r\n- Client sends another request to the server (`java/generateToString`), using the properties the user selected\r\n- Server responds with a `WorkspaceEdit`, that the client applies\r\n\r\nThis is all completely custom\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso note that what lspconfig does (or did?) with `commands` was to provide sugar for neovim _user_ commands definitions. That's not really specific to the LSP module at all.\r\n",
