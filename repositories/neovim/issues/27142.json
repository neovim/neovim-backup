What happens is, when you run \"devpod up\" the container is created and you are told to do \"ssh yourworkscape.devpod\". It turns out DevPod change your ~/.ssh/config and this ssh command is actualy a ProxyCommand in your ~/.ssh/config like this: \"ProxyCommand devpod ssh --stdio --context default --user dev yourworkspace\".\r\n\r\nThe thing is, no matter what I change inside the container, accessing it with this command always break Neovim/Astronvim UI.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end. I came with two workaround for this:\r\n1. wrap your session with Tmux or Screen and run neovim (after you enter the container with ssh as being told by devpod)\r\n2. access your container with docker ie: docker container exec -it containername bash, and run neovim\r\n\r\nBoth approach works perfectly, but its still a bit annoying :)\r\n\r\n",

After trying @marcelomendes first workaround; running tmux inside the container then opening neovim. That worked for me.\r\n\r\nSo I took a look at the output of env, and saw that TERM was set to \"screen\". I had tried changing the TERM variable to xterm or alacritty (I did install the terminal info as well with no luck) or xterm-256color with no luck.\r\n\r\nSo I added the following to the beginning .ssh/config, this will match any containers created by devpod\r\n```\r\nHost *.devpod\r\n  ForwardAgent yes\r\n  LogLevel error\r\n  StrictHostKeyChecking no\r\n  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null\r\n  User vscode\r\n  SetEnv TERM=screen\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now neovim is working as expected. I'm not sure what the ProxyCommand that devpod uses does but it looks like the screen terminal type is simple enough that it works.\r\n\r\nHoping it helps",
