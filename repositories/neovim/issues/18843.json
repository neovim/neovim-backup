From a semantical point of view it's pretty different. EOL whitespaces are errors, listchar is a visual insight helper mechanism not designed to spot errors.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of adding a specific highlight (which themes or users could decide to customize) as proposed in the vim issue sounds pretty good to me, but at the same time I'm not exactly competent enough to know the impact of such a change.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, this issue could also open a discussion for unification (and thus simplification) with `c_space_errors` at a more language agnostic level.\r\n\r\nIf needed, I don't mind eventually submitting a PR if there is a consensus on a solution, but I'm going to be honest, flagging this issue as \"documentation\" feels very off.",

So it indeed belongs in the general category of \"specific kinds of whitespace\" that `listchar` serves. \r\n\r\nAdding a separate Highlight group for `WhitespaceEOL` would be a low-level code change (equivalent to the snippet you are so opposed to), but increases documentation and maintenance burden for relatively little gain (saving some users two lines in their config). (It's not just the single feature, but also the interaction with existing and future features that needs to be taken into consideration -- you also have to draw the line somewhere, otherwise you'll end up with thousands of special-interest highlight groups, which is also bad for users.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, allowing `listchar` (and similar options) not just to take a character but a highlight group as well would be a more involved change but give a lot more flexibility, so the gain would be larger. \r\n\r\n> Generally speaking, this issue could also open a discussion for unification (and thus simplification) with c_space_errors at a more language agnostic level.\r\n\r\nActually, `c_space_errors` _is_ a cross-language feature in Vim syntax files (grep it in your runtime directory). If your language is EOL whitespace aware, I'd recommend asking Vim (or, rather, the syntax file maintainer) to add this option to the corresponding syntax file.",
