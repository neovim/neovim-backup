In https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/18476#issuecomment-1120390374, @mfussenegger mentioned:\r\n\r\n>:lsp / :LspInfo: LspInfo currently does more than just printing all clients, it also prints all not started yet. It can do that because lsp-config currently includes the \"managing clients\" functionality. I think the first step we have to do to bring anything like that into core is to move the manager component.\r\n\r\nNvim core would need the concept of \"registering\" or \"managing\" a client without it being started. For example, a `vim.lsp.register` API that makes Nvim aware of a client configuration without actually starting it. This same functionality would be needed for `:LspStart` as well, if we want to include that.\r\n\r\nI do not think we should include `:LspInfo` directly, but its functionality should be integrated into `:checkhealth lsp`.\r\n\r\nIf we do add `:LspStart` and/or `:LspStop`, I propose they be added as `:lsp start` and `:lsp stop` and promote `:lsp` to a first class command (note, this is a different interface thn the one proposed in #18476).\r\n\r\ncc @mfussenegger ",

After https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3734 the command now requires the server name to be passed on Neovim 0.11.2+\n\nIt's not too difficult to implement manually (see my snippet in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/33978#discussioncomment-13372488), but might be useful for others. I also currently loop through `vim.lsp.config._configs` to identify all configured LSPs and get their `filetypes`, so that might be a candidate for an API too (maybe just a getter `vim.lsp.get_configs()`, or something like `vim.lsp.get_configs_for_filetype(ft)`).\n\n`LspStop` has the same change (it now requires an argument), but that one is more straightforward and could maybe be a `:lsp stop_all/disable_all` subcommand, which just disables all enabled servers.\n\n(if any of this seems sensible I'd be curious to submit a PR 😀)",

It only requires adding _a single line_ to Nvim codebase, but will offer a lot more flexibility (it automatically work with command-modifiers, external commands, terminal emulator). Also Nvim already has `$NVIM_LOG_FILE`",
