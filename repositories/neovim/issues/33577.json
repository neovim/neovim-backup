    "body": "## Problem\n\n#33575 aims to begin upstreaming configs from nvim-lspconfig. When doing this, we may experience some issues with the current merge semantics of `vim.lsp.config` with some of the complex configs. This is due to the fact the merge semantics is just the behaviour of `vim.tbl_deep_extend` and thus has no way of removing `nil` values.\n\nExamples:\n1. Core ships a config that defines `root_dir`, but the user just wants their config to use `root_markers`\n2. Core ships a config with a complex `reuse_client` field, but the user wants to use the default.\n3. Core ships a config with an `on_attach` field which the user does not want.\n\n## Possible solutions\n\n1. Use `vim.NIL` as a special value in merging to mean \"delete this value\"\n\n2. Allow `lsp/*` files to return a directive (similar to treesitter query files) to define the merge semantics of that config.\n\n   E.g. `return { ... }, 'override'`\n \n3. Modify the configuration schema so every field has an explicit opt-out value (e.g. `false`)\n\n   E.g. if a field is of type `function?` change this to `function|false?` so that function can be removed.\n\n   #33579",

            "body": "I think there is also something to be said about merging semantics of `on_attach` in order to support merging the functions in some way. If the user defines a default `on_attach` function with `vim.lsp.config(\"*\", { on_attach = function(client, bufnr) end })` which does core work that they want to apply to all language servers, it would be nice if there was a way to do language specific setup with `vim.lsp.config(server_name, { on_attach = function(client, bufnr) end })` to do language specific `on_attach` functions.\n\nThis also shows up in the case where the user sets up a default with `\"*\"` and then utilizes `nvim-lspconfig` which provides LSP configuration through runtime files where some of them provide an `on_attach` function which sets up things such as useful user commands. This would promptly override what the user specified that they wanted with `\"*\"` which may not be the intended behavior especially when most of the language servers will work fine and only the subset that do add `on_attach` functions would behave differently.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to expect the user to rely more heavily on the `LspAttach` event to set up autocommands rather than recommending they use `on_attach` in `vim.lsp.config`. If that's the case then maybe it's good to mention that in the documentation.",

I don't think we'll be changing the merging semantics in any significant way. We'll have to add other solutions to specific problems, or just not address them at all. Complicated server setups probably shouldn't use `vim.lsp.config` and use `vim.lsp.start` instead.

If we just remove the caching then for `lsp/` we get the same effect of allowing the config to be a function, we'd just need to pass the current config as a module argument. E.g.\n\nI mean I wouldn't *really* expect users to constantly restart their LSP-Servers, so I'm not *quite* sure caching is actually useful?\n\nThe hardest part about caching is of cause *as always* to get the invalidation semantics right. But I think the solution would probably come down to \"let the user register some callback that checks whether the config should be recomputed/that mutates the config if necessary\".\n\nOne alternative to doing caching invalidation, though I'm not quite sure as viable it is, could be to use actual dynamic values, by using an `__index` metatable.\n\nTo still allow correct layering the configurations it would only provide \"dynamic defaults\":\n\n```lua\nreturn function(config)\n    return setmetatable({ _inner }, {\n        __index = function(t,k)\n            if not t._inner[k] then\n            -- provide dynamic value here\n            end\n        end,\n        __newindex = function(t,k,v)\n            t.inner[k] = v\n       end\n    })\nend\n```\n\n\n ",

Add a new `behavior='keepall'` to `vim.tbl_deep_extend` which more aggressively merges things. \n    - In particular, it \"merges\" functions by creating a closure that calls both functions, instead of just replacing the old one.\n2. Allow Config to be a functions (instead of a `LspConfig` table)\n    - Details [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32287#issuecomment-2835155023). This will require a bit more work.\n    - Eliminate `before_init`. Discussion [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32287#issuecomment-2835187868).",
