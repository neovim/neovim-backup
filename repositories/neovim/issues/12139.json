I'm sure there are legacy reasons for this error, but it's a pretty poor experience these days that probably doesn't need to stick around. (at least with `set hidden` enabled)\r\n\r\nI've learned I can run `:next *.js` which has the behaviour I want, but `next` is a pretty unintuitive name and I don't really see a reason to have more than one command for this functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, perhaps we could simply add a note saying `Maybe you meant to use :next` to the error message? It took a bit of digging to find that solution and I'd love it if others didn't need to do the same.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your work everyone!\r\n",
