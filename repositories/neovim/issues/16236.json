However, sometimes I just want to quit without saving and now need to remember to use `:q!` instead of `:q`\r\n\r\nIt would be very convenient if you could define the events that trigger an autowrite (switching buffers, editing new files, quitting). Then `autowrite` and `autowriteall` could also be merged into one setting - a list of events.",
