As a workaound, the stuck window can be focused with the mouse and `Q` will close it.\n\nIn the case of smaller tooltip-style windows there appears to be no way to focus the window, therefore no way to `Q` it. Seeing this happen fairly regularly.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a29cb3-e384-4dfe-977d-0a454fccdde3)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim with kickstart.nvim, lsp's tested gopls, deno\n\n- edit file\n- hover and `K` over a function\n- `gd` to navigate to it's definition\n- see the problem, scroll around\n- `C-O` to pop back to the previous file\n\n### Expected behavior\n\npopup windows should disappear when navigating to new buffer via `gd` or anything else\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n11.3 release\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nn/a\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm + ghostty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nrelease appimage",
