    "body": "### Problem\n\nSometimes concealed text in one buffer is replaced by a :syn-cchar defined in a different buffer's syntax rules.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis isn't easy to reproduce; I suspect it's caused by a race condition in the syntax highlighting between different buffers. The simplest reproducer I've found so far is:\r\n```\r\nnvim --clean -c 'checkhealth|vert help reference_toc'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes, but not always, help tags in the `:help` window will render with a ─ (U+2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL) on either side of them, like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f5ef6f1-bceb-48f4-bf16-1dde330aee6c)\r\n\r\nPressing Ctrl-L may fix that:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/322cfcbf-f960-4c12-8d4b-a2f61d0157b9)\r\n\r\nThough pressing Ctrl-L again may make it recur, toggling between the two states.\r\n\r\nThat box drawing character is configured in `runtime/syntax/checkhealth.vim`:\r\n```vim\r\nsyn match healthHeadingChar \"=\" conceal cchar=─ contained containedin=helpSectionDelim\r\n```\r\nBut that is not expected to affect the behavior of an ft=help buffer.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen more often with certain terminal sizes (I've been reproducing it in a 100 column by 40 line terminal fairly regularly).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe `|` surrounding help tags should be hidden at `conceallevel=2`, rather than replaced with `─`.\r\n\r\nI see that there's a static variable called `static int current_sub_char = 0;` that stores the \"current\" `cchar`, but it's not clear to me how that's meant to work across different buffers. It seems as though one buffer is seeing a cchar that only exists in the syntax rules for a different buffer.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-660+gcf44121f7\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI can't reproduce reliably enough to be sure (given no :checkhealth in vim)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 24.04\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nTested with Windows Terminal and wsltty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nNightly release from GitHub",
