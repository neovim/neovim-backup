If it's slower than that, then your OS/filesystem is unusually slow.\r\n\r\n> Should be able to see the difference when deleting characters fast with `x`\r\n\r\nHammering `x` is an edge case. But this serves to illustrate that `clipboard=unnamed` is silly: why send thousands of updates to your OS clipboard from Vim? Why would one want `x` to overwrite the OS clipboard?\r\n\r\nOne can instead make a mapping, then just hit `Y` during visual-mode to copy to clipboard:\r\n\r\n    xnoremap Y \"+y\r\n\r\nThen you don't need `clipboard=unnamed`, and your clipboard will have actually useful things in it, instead of junk from a random `x` command.\r\n\r\nBut it's always good to make things faster if possible.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11089, this approach could fix `clipboard=unnamed` performance:\r\n\r\n- Delay clipboard _set_ until...\r\n  -  FocusLost event\r\n  - InsertEnter\r\n  - CmdlineEnter\r\n- On FocusLost event...\r\n  - disable the  performance hack (\"deferred clipboard set\"), because the slowness won't be noticed by a human\r\n\r\nSo we can leave this open in case anyone wants to work on that.

If it's slower than that, then your OS/filesystem is unusually slow.\r\n\r\n> Should be able to see the difference when deleting characters fast with `x`\r\n\r\nHammering `x` is an edge case. But this serves to illustrate that `clipboard=unnamed` is silly: why send thousands of updates to your OS clipboard from Vim? Why would one want `x` to overwrite the OS clipboard?\r\n\r\nOne can instead make a mapping, then just hit `Y` during visual-mode to copy to clipboard:\r\n\r\n    xnoremap Y \"+y\r\n\r\nThen you don't need `clipboard=unnamed`, and your clipboard will have actually useful things in it, instead of junk from a random `x` command.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n`clipboard=unnamed` is a questionable feature, but performance improvements are welcome if they don't add much risk. From https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11089, this approach could fix `clipboard=unnamed` performance:\r\n\r\n- Delay clipboard _set_ until...\r\n  -  FocusLost event\r\n  - InsertEnter\r\n  - CmdlineEnter\r\n- On FocusLost event...\r\n  - disable the  performance hack (\"deferred clipboard set\"), because the slowness won't be noticed by a human\r\n- Implementation provided here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21739#issuecomment-1399405391\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Locked to keep the summary visible.
