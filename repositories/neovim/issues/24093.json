    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nWhen used with a terminal app which supports CSI-u sequences, neovim will use those to get more fine-grained key combo information for key combos, to be able to detect sequences such as shift+enter or shift+space. In `:terminal` mode, nvim will reproduce those CSI-u sequences. That means, when you hit shift+space in `:terminal` mode, neovim will send `\\e[32;2u` to the terminal instead of a space character, and when you hit shift+enter, neovim will send `\\e[13;2u` instead of a line feed character.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic. On most systems I've encountered, `\\e[32;2u` and `\\e13;2u` aren't interpreted as space or enter by default by any shell, which means the user ends up with garbage in their terminal if they accidentally hit space before letting go of enter. While some programs can be manually configured to understand the CSI-u sequences properly, it seems unreasonable to expect the user to manually go through every system they ever interact with (directly, through SSH, through serial, whatever) and reconfigure readline and whatever other line reading libraries are in use by terminal software they use.\r\n\r\nI believe neovim should, by default, do what iTerm2 does by default: send a space character when shift+space is pressed and a line feed character when shift+enter is pressed, unless CSI-u mode is enabled by a program printing `\\e[>1u` to the terminal, at which point it starts reporting those sequences using CSI-u. If that's too much work, I think disabling CSI-u for shift+enter and shift+space would be better than the current situation.\r\n\r\nNote: As a workaround, shift+space and shift+enter can be remapped to space and enter with `tmap <S-Space> <Space>` and `tmap <S-Enter> <Enter>`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `nvim --clean`\r\n2. `:terminal`\r\n3. Press shift+enter or shift+space\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe shift key should be ignored, a space or enter should be written to the terminal. This is what iTerm2 and, I believe, most other terminals with CSI-u support do.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.9.1\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nNo, vim's :terminal mode sends a space and enter character for shift+space/shift+enter\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 13.4\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\n3.4.19\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nHomebrew",

I don't believe https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/18735 should have been closed like that. @justinmk closed it with the comment that neovim \"can't be expected to force nested terminal programs to also support CSIu\", which, while correct, is irrelevant. iTerm2 also supports CSIu, and iTerm2 also can't be expected to force programs to support CSIu... which is why iTerm2 doesn't send CSIu until the program running in the terminal has claimed to support CSIu by outputting `\\e[>1u`. I'm suggesting that neovim should act the same way as other terminal emulators.\r\n2. Even if neovim doesn't want to be well-behaved with regards to CSIu sequences in general, I think there's a vast difference between \"ctrl-/ doesn't work in fzf\", which is a pretty niche issue which could be reasonably fixed by making fzf support CSIu, and \"basic typing is broken in all popular shells\". I think a special workaround for shift+space is warranted even if fzf remains broken.\r\n\r\nI believe that this issue should be re-opened so that we can actually have these discussions. If not, I want the neovim team to express clearly that the intention is for shift+space to remain broken, without hiding behind this tangentially related fzf issue.",

It's easy enough to disable CSIu encoding in vterm (it's enabled unconditionally by default), but supporting even level one of the kitty keyboard protocol (\"Disambiguate escape codes\") will not be straightforward because Nvim \"merges\" modifiers so that by the time the keys get processed, `<C-I>` is indistinguishable from `<Tab>` (even though the parent terminal emulator distinguishes these because Nvim enables the kitty keyboard protocol itself, Nvim then turns around and re-ambiguates it)[^1].\n\nSo even if an application running in a terminal buffer enables the disambiguate escape codes mode with `CSI > 1 u`, it won't make any difference right now (at least for keys like `C-M`, `C-I`, `C-[`, and `C-J`). We'd need to make changes deep in Nvim's input processing code.\n\nI think the simplest thing to do now is just disable vterm's unconditional CSIu encoding. That solves this issue at least.\n\n[^1]: It doesn't do this if there is a mapping for `<C-I>` though",
