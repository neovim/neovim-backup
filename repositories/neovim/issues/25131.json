Another side effect of `reset` is that code actions from that namespace disappear also.\r\n\r\nI suppose this could be used in combination with `disable` to hide the diagnostics and also affect the output of those other commands (e.g. call `reset` before calling `goto_next`), but even this isn't what I want in this case, since I want tsserver's code actions without its diagnostics for javascript buffers, which would disappear each time I call `reset` and before I make another edit",
