    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen running a program directly in the terminal, if that program handles Ctrl+Z itself (as LazyGit does) to suspend itself, then the terminal is left in a hard-to-exit state: it's in input mode so all keystrokes are sent to the running program, but the running program is suspended so nothing is listening. Typing `fg` to unsuspend the program doesn't work like in Bash or other shells, because there isn't a shell in between the terminal and the suspended process. The only ways to get out of this state are:\n\n1. Hit C-\\ C-n (or some other key map mapped to the same thing) to get back into normal mode in the terminal.\n2. Type `:q` to exit the terminal window, killing the suspended process\n\nAlternately, one could find the process ID in the status line and run `kill -s CONT (pid)` to manually unsuspend the process by sending it SIGCONT, e.g. if the terminal URL is showing as `term://~/tmp/nvim//1792015:lazygit` then one can run `kill -s CONT 1792015` to unsuspend the LazyGit process and get back to normal operation.\n\nIt would be nice if the terminal could implement the same job-control mechanisms that Bash and other shells do, detecting when a child process has received SIGSTOP (which also sends SIGCHLD to the parent process, e.g. NeoVim) and allowing the `fg` command (which a Linux poweruser will likely have as a finger macro) to send SIGCONT to the child process. Or perhaps some other way of handling the situation that I haven't thought of.\n\nThis problem will probably arise only rarely, as most software apparently either doesn't catch Ctrl+Z (letting the shell catch it and send SIGSTOP to the child), or else the software handles input itself and uses Ctrl+Z for other things such as undo. So far LazyGit is the only software I've found that handles Ctrl+Z by sending itself SIGSTOP, and the terminal window isn't set up to handle that situation gracefully.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun `nvim --clean`\n`:term lazygit` and press Enter\nType `a` or `i` to send input to the terminal\nInside LazyGit, press C-z (Ctrl+Z) to suspend it\nLazyGit sends itself SIGSTOP and suspends itself\nBack at terminal in input mode, but nothing is listening to input\nLook at process ID of lazygit\nIn another terminal (outside of NeoVim), run `ps -s CONT (pid)`\nInside NeoVim, the LazyGit process has resumed in the terminal\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe terminal would notice SIGCHLD and handle it appropriately, perhaps by handling someone typing `fg<CR>` and turning that into a SIGCONT, or else by displaying a message like `[Process suspended, press any key to resume it]`.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.5, and also v0.12.0-dev-2103+g95b03171df\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nYes, vim 9.1.2077\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nghostty 1.2.3-arch2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-ghostty\n\n### Installation\n\nArch package manager (pacman -S neovim)",
