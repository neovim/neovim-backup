When set to false, neovim acts as usual When 'autochdir' is set, neovim changes the directory to the project directory~~\n    - *(2024 justinmk)* Doesn't seem necessary; instead, always do the right thing based on the presence of `&l:rootdir` or `.nvim.lua` ?\n- `projectfunc: string` (default: empty) Decides the project directory by a custom function. If nil, the project directory is determined by searching parent directories for the projectfiles\n    - *(2024 justinmk)* related: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31630\n- `projectdir: string` (default: empty) Set by projectfunc or projectfiles.  The directory of the project\n    - *(2024 justinmk)* I assume this is buffer-local option? Alternative names: `rootdir`, `workdir`\n- `projectfiles: list` (default: \".git,src,etc\") Files/directories to search for in parent directories.  Searches from left to right eg. search for .git, then src, etc\n    - *(2024 justinmk)* In `vim.lsp.config` we named this `root_markers`.",

The problem with that is that with large projects with multiple directories, files like Session.vim, tags files, and other similar \"project files\" could be anywhere within the project. With a \"project\" feature, neovim would use commands like vimgrep, make, cs add [file], etc and load files (eg Session.vim) from the project directory.\r\n\r\nWhy do you `cd` to the file in the first place?  Is that in Neovim or before starting it? (just asking to understand your use case)\r\n\r\nIs the idea of this future for Neovim to set the `projectdir` variable automatically?\r\nWould it do things based on that itself?
