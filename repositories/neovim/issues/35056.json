If in doubt, `:restart`.\n\nYes there is? It's like, mandatory for interactively working on queries without wasting a ton of your time? It could even be scoped properly to just the query being edited if one is writing this less lazily than I would write in my user configuration.\n\nEither way, currently clearing the query cache is not a public API, so writing code to fix this in user config is going to be fragile; a public API should be added even if you don't want to fix this UX regression.",
