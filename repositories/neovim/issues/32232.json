It links to this address which is incorrect\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n\nThe section says \"Latest stable release\". It links to this address.\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest\n\nWhich redirects to `v0.10.3`. That release contains an asset named nvim-linux64.tar.gz\n\nSo I assume the correct link in `INSTALL.md` should be this\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-linux64.tar.gz\n\nI was going to raise a PR, but I had a question. I would assume that \"Latest stable release\" would link to the release tagged as stable? So `releases/tag/stable` rather than `releases/latest`?\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe link correctly works.",
