The challenge is to exercise all bundled queries without having to hard-code the list.\r\n\r\nRough strategy would be \r\n1. find all query files on runtimepath\r\n2. split them by language and type\r\n3. try to `vim.treesitter.query.get(lang, type)`\r\n4. (optionally) capture and present any errors.",
