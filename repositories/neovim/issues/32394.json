AFAICT, its main point is that Nvim doesn't have CRDTs, which is required in order to map edit operations to Zed.\n\nWork on multicursor will nudge towards \"atomizing\" operations in Nvim, which will help a bit, but is still very far from rearchitecting Vim to represent edits as CRDTs.\n\nThe door is open to exploring that, but it's quite possible that it's lower-leverage than just throwing out Vim entirely, and switching all efforts to Zed.\n\nGoing to close this issue since it's a low-effort request.",
