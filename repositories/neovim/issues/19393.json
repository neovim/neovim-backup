The function shown on reddit was like 8 lines from what i remember. Second of all you'd have to make several remaps and functions for the different keys, like dd, x and dw etc.\r\n\r\nI do understand your concern, but I was thinking more about doing the change on the registers directly, instead of changing the behavior of the keys. So for example dd works exactly the same, but the register just discards anything thats empty. This might be impossible to do though depending on the code structure.",
