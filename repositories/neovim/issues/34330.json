    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim currently allows multiple UI clients to connect to a single backend session, but all UI clients share the same global window layout (splits, tabs, window sizes, etc.). This limitation prevents multiple frontends—such as multiple GUI windows or remote clients—from having their own customized window arrangements while editing the same buffers.\n\nIn contrast, some other editors or environments (like Emacs with multiple frames) allow independent window layouts per client/frame. This flexibility improves usability in multi-monitor or multi-frontend workflows.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEach UI client should maintain its own independent window layout, including splits, tabs, and window sizes, while still sharing the same underlying buffers and editing state. Commands that manipulate window layout (e.g., :split, :tabnew) would only affect the client that issues them, not globally across all clients.\n\nThis feature would enable users to have multiple Neovim GUI windows (or other UI clients) connected to one session, each with layouts optimized for their own screen or purpose, greatly improving multi-monitor and collaborative editing experiences.\n\nThough it requires significant architectural changes to decouple window layout state from being global, the improved flexibility and usability make it a valuable enhancement for the Neovim ecosystem.",
