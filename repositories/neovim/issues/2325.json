This works fine with vim (with guioptions=a & mouse=a), but sadly not with neovim.\n\n@bfredl you said:\n\n> invoke xsel on every visual mode keypress\n\nI don't think visual keyboard selection is such an issue. If I make a visual selection with the keyboard, I expect to have to yank (with the keyboard) to get it into the clipboard.\n\nAs you say:\n\n> the case of mouse selection is simpler, just update when the mouse is released\n\nI'm hoping this is still possible ?\n",
