I think we should consider reworking memfile,regexp engine and all related code to allow editing files that do not fit into the available memory.\r\nAt this time it means that all API functions should be designed as if files are all impossible to load into memory (e.g. you cannot request a piece of file without specifying maximum length you can accept). On VimL side this will result in adding string-pretending lua objects that may be returned by getline()/@c/... and that actually use file positions + binary diffs (API must have FileChangeWritten hooks providing all necessary information) with a warning that editing file (but _not_ appending to it) outside of vim may result in changing some \"strings\". It is better to create infrastructure for handling this on new VimL side right now.\r\n\r\nAn idea for API: getline() C implementation should look like\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    fpos_t start;  // First byte position\r\n    fpos_t end;    // Last byte position\r\n    size_t len;    // Length of the next field\r\n    char string[1];\r\n} FileString;\r\n```\r\n",

Nothing can prevent you from creating `fgetc`-based parser which will parse the whole file without ever loading it into memory completely. More, you can syntax check the whole file without both having syntax tree of the whole file in memory and having the file itself in memory.\n\nEven more: if the file is not loaded into memory it does not mean API cannot pretend it is. You can use `mmap` to map the whole file into memory (unless it is large enough for it to be impossible to be addressed), but that does not mean it will be actually loaded: kernel may and sometimes does choose to load file only on page fault: when process tried to access file, not when process called `mmap`.\n",

When the RAM runs out the swap partition is temporarily assigned the work of RAM, it is much more space to work with, but much slower, unless it's an SSD, which should be used for swap partitions as that can reduce the life of the SSD AFAIK.\n\nMaybe the swapfile is similar just for Vim specifically? Gotta remember Vim was coded when GBs upon GBs of RAM weren't available. :)\n\nIf I'm wrong, anyone, feel free to correct me, since I'm just using related(?) knowledge to fill this void in my knowledge. :)\n",

Quite fragile.\n\nThen there's encoding conversions, which as of right now require the entire file to be read at once. Some encodings are self-synchronizing, like utf-8, so that's easier to support.\n\nActually, now that I think about it more, such a thing would presuppose a dynamic `ml_delete() / ml_append()` scroller than pages in lines from an mmap'ed fd (windows [MapViewOfFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366761%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and converts them on request.

If so, then yes, that's true :). Also did you know that OSX's malloc() uses only mmap()? Afaik OSX doesn't even implement the (s)brk() system calls.\n\nIn any case, I'm afraid it doesn't have too much bearing. Here's something that does (these links have been posted in other issues): \n- https://github.com/martanne/vis\n- https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf\n\nSimply put, currently Vim has a line-based system. Which I appreciate for its elegance/simplicity. Yet it also implies that really large files are difficult. The mmap() I and the paper/program authors are referring to is the direct mmap() of a file to be able to read its contents through demand paging, not an anonymous mmap() used to get memory from the kernel to allocate.\n",

            "body": "Nvim project: just great!. Brings one of my \"dreams\" come to reality. For years wanted to write a kind of clone for vim where main requirement was to be able to open an arbitrary large file (as big as RAM allows). The main use case was to open an aggregation of source files, books, anything that could be converted to text and do kind fast fuzzy find like searches inside text, find relation between parts of text (like definition of a variable, usage etc.). I used to hack a bit the source code of vim, do not remember too much now, but I think one of the obvious issues that slows down a bit opening of huge files and this cannot be avoided, vim (and as any editor would do) needs to parse the newlines to satisfy commands like :1234 (go to line). Ideally reading such big files should be done in a background thread, and the user should be able to start to interact with the chunk already loaded. \n\nBTW: did not find so far any reference: does neovim intend to implement threads? Lot of processing could be/should be done in background threads. Often browsing huge files (huge XML for instance) is slow as syntax highlighting and other plugins needs time to react. If all this would be done in a backgroud thread, main operations would be hyper fast, while \"decorators\" could be delayed.\n\n@aktau : do not remember exactly, years ago was looking at what is the best algorithm for editor. Found somewhere a nice article that compares approaches, and I think the conclusion was that best is to work with transaction log. No change is made in the original buffer. When the file is written the transaction log is processed and pieces from original are copied. I think this is also what is done in vim, or? \n",

However in certain cases, when you open a large XML file or similar situations, plugins tend to slow down the user experince, things like scroll down/up etc. The reason is that all operations need to be done in parallel. Scrolling itself which is the most important is jeopardized by the plugins. Threads could help here obviously.\n\nI understand however making it thread safe is indeed very complex. I was wondering if you have it as objective... Maybe a complete rewrite would have been probably an alternative to consider. Obviously one would have wanted to keep the script interface to keep the large script asset base.\n\nNow as you say co processes are the only solution, do you have any design document about that? I think would not be bad to think about separating the basic/core operations being done in a core process. This core process would prepare all the data structures relevant for the buffers (newlines, undo etc. etc.). Coprocesses could read-only \"mirror\" these data structures through shared memory and do things like syntax highlighting and run other scripts. This could be done with some segment/offset addressing, where offsets would be equal in data-structures in both processes and segment pointers would point to the start of the shared memory in processes/co-processes.\n",

The idea was not to use locking at all, and \"slow\" VimL scripts or dynamic language scripts would run in a separate thread and would just read-only-consume buffers. Main thread (or process with shared memory), would manipulate buffers, and as response to any action that would change the buffer, would first notify consumer threads to invalidate their knowledge (to avoid accessing invalid memory), update buffer, and send another message to consumers, that new \"model\" is available in the shared memory. I am still not sure what would be the best to stop a thread if it is doing a busy action.\n",

            "body": "back here... what about using fibers instead of threads. Exactly like jobstart, one could have a feature fiberstart which could be called both by vim scripts and C. Fiberstart would create a new stack and call the fiber function on a this stack. The main problem would be how to implement concurrency. This would be a little tricky, but once the the programming model accepted, should work without problem. The main fiber (the vim interface) is \"interrupting\" itself on the event loop, so this one could allow the control logic to decide if it is time to give processor to another fiber. If we have a calculation fiber that has some longer calculation, may cause the ui seem sluggish. So one has to insert interrupt points in such a code. And here comes a trivial solution: Each function called by the fibers should be a call to a wrapper. Such a wrapper will check if time slice for the fiber is exhausted. If yes, give the processor to the next fiber, otherwise continue. While it sounds hackish would be a simple/trivial \"thread safe\" parallel processing for tools like vim.\n",

For example, if the debug output of a server is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING::file.py:100::This is a test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `setl tailformat=WARNING::%f:%l:\\(\\.*\\)` or similar would print out the according error into the quickfix menu and allow the user to navigate to `file.py` at line 100.\r\n\r\nThis is simple enough to do, but it has to tail the file descriptor and parse these error messages in real-time.\r\n\r\nThe problem of large file support could be reduced to the one I'm describing, because in both cases, you're lazily reading/parsing what's being outputted onto the screen.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I'd have to override `BufOpen` and insert my own logic in its place in order to accomplish this, which I don't know how to do; any suggestions?",

            "body": "I think it would be a worthwhile effort to first abstract buffers, and provide a way of creating external buffers that can use arbitrary, custom data structures.\r\n\r\nA rough idea of the interface (in C, just to express types):\r\n\r\nExternal buffer provider defines the following methods for neovim to use:\r\n\r\n- `get_lines`\r\n  ```c\r\n  kvec_t(String) get_lines(linenr_T start, linenr_T end);\r\n  ```\r\n  Neovim calls this method to fetch lines.\r\n  Maybe there could be a way of fetching just a parts of lines, so if there is a really long line, only the displayed part could be fetched for rendering.\r\n\r\n- `set_text`\r\n  ```c\r\n  void set_text(lpos_T start, lpos_T end, kvec_t(String) text);\r\n  ```\r\n  Neovim calls this method when it modifies text. The provider updates its internal data structures with the new text.\r\n  Maybe this method could reject the new text (implementing validation for text forms?) and return a status.\r\n\r\nProvider sends the following notifications to neovim:\r\n\r\n- `line_count_changed`\r\n  ```c\r\n  void line_count_changed(linenr_T line_count);\r\n  ```\r\n  The provider notifies neovim when the line count changes, neovim caches the value.\r\n  I'm assuming the line count can be needed quite often, so to limit the amount of requests the provider notifies about it instead of neovim explicitly asking about it.\r\n\r\n- `text_changed`\r\n  ```c\r\n  void text_changed(lpos_T start, lpos_T old_end, lpos_T new_end);\r\n  ```\r\n  The provider notifies neovim about any external changes made to the text. Neovim triggers buffer update callbacks based on this. Actual contents of the new text are not sent. If it's actually needed, neovim will fetch it with `get_lines`.\r\n  Neovim could also cache lines, and invalidate the cache based on this notification.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther than implementing more efficient data structures, having that would enable other editors that embed neovim to reuse their own data structures.\r\nAnother use case for this is fuzzy finders, that might store millions of items. Only the range of items that can fit in the window can be passed to neovim.",
