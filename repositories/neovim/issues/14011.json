Consider  watching sc-im [screencast](https://youtu.be/K_8_gazN7h0) I reference at the bottom of this comment to see where it could begin, and the potential it already has. That has been suggested below as a way to poll neovim users for interest in this feature, and make your voice heard to neovim dev team.**\r\n\r\n[sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im) is the improved/improvised version of [sc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc_(spreadsheet_calculator)) spreadsheet calculator program based on vim bindings, vim modal behavior (normal, visual, insert, command). It's script looks like Vimscript, and it integrates with Lua 5.1 (one can manipulate entire spreadsheet from Lua side).\r\n\r\nThe project seems to be a lone person's project, and might benefit from the sponsorship, support, and C+Lua expertise that neovim has. Here are some screenshots, and links to videos:\r\n\r\n1) A spreadsheet for converting 0-255 color range of RGB to 0-1000 color range of ncursesw's RGB for [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com).  Cells in magenta are expressions that sc-im evaluated. One can write an expression once, and yank it (using yy), then enter visual (block) mode mode (entered by simply pressing v in normal mode) and select cells by pressing h/j/k/l or arrow keys, and finally paste the expression by pressing p.\r\n<img width=\"1043\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-24 at 3 39 16 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71736629/109081692-8527c180-76b7-11eb-9229-1ee53066ea01.png\">\r\n\r\n2) Startup screen:\r\n<img width=\"1085\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-24 at 3 37 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71736629/109082122-33cc0200-76b8-11eb-9d5c-731c0e8cf26e.png\">\r\n\r\n3) Screencast that shows some basic features: https://youtu.be/K_8_gazN7h0\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Having this under the umbrella of neovim's team would bring about the best synergistic result I think. On one hand it will add immense value to neovim (to edit & operate on tabular data), and on the other hand it will support the program itself in long run. I have been using it since last two days, and for the very first time in my life I am loving the process of  making new spreadsheets. It needs some bug fixes, and improvements though. The Lua side for expressions and controlling the results seems more solid (I had only one [glitch](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/issues/496) so far), their vim-script side seems to have more bug (like the one [bug](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/issues/497) I field yesterday). I think they need more C side expertise, and it would make sense to just have one vim-script (instead of them having their own flavor), and common integration with Lua. It is very fast though, unlike a very basic csv plugin written in vimscript: https://github.com/chrisbra/csv.vim",

If you think having a neovim interface to sci-im would do so, I encourage you to implement a lua based plugin, and then advertise it to show people the exciting features that only sci-im.nvim (name free for use) can achieve. Even if you were to bundle sci-vim with neovim, this is (practically speaking) how such an integration would likely take place, which means a lua based plugin will be functionally equivalent.\r\n\r\nBundling another C library as part of nvim (sci-im is ~1/2 the size of luajit) doesn't achieve much other than one less dependency for users to install should they want sci-im. I don't speak for anyone, but I personally have no use for this (I would use a programmatic interface via DataFrames.jl or pandas to work with tabular data), and would not be incentivized to contribute to sci-im development if it were bundled with software I actively contribute to.\r\n\r\n@bfredl it doesn't look like it, seems pretty tightly coupled to ncurses ",
