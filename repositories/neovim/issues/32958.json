Using the XDG data dir is a stronger, more expectable default. It is also more in line with the XDG base dir spec than using the config dir.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nBy default the files with added words are placed in `stdpath('data')/spell`.",

It does not configure Nvim and is not even hand-written by a user. Even more so for the (binary) `.spl` files.\n\nI can't find it in the current version of the XDG spec, but the data directory was _meant_ to contain files that user may want to backup. Files that are definitely not meant to be included in a backup, should go in state or cache.\n\nHowever, the XDG spec is pretty vague about which directory should contain what type of files, and the lines between configuration, data, and state files are pretty thin. To me, a word list that is generated and modified by Nvim feels more like data than configuration.\n\n---\n\nOn another note, would this be considered for implementation, what would be the best approach: Just default `'spellfile'` to `$XDG_DATA_HOME .. 'spell/{spelllang}.{encoding}.add'`, or modify it in source (spellfile.c?)?\n\nThe pro's for setting `'spellfile'` are that it's simple to implement, easier to patch spellfile.c source from Vim, and clear to the user. The cons are that if `'spellfile'` is unset, the current default behaviour is that Nvim sets the filename based on the first lang in `'spelllang'`. I'm not sure if that's possible by just setting `'spellfile'` to a default value.",

Here the answer is not quite as clear-cut; I feel there's good arguments for either choice.

They are just checked to find the first writable directory, and than it is used. Thus either:\n\n1. `'spellfile'` is not set, and will be set to `rtp[0]/spell/{spelllang}.{encoding}.add` by Nvim upon first usage, e.g. after `zg` the value of `'spellfile'` is `/Users/yochem/.config/nvim/spell/en.utf-8.add`.\n2. `'spellfile'` is set: can be either one file or a list of files. These will be used.\n\nThis means that this would be a breaking change: if users did not set `'spellfile'` before and rely on the first rtp path being consistent, this would break if the default behaviour is changed to have stdpath('data') as default. They would need to either move their spell files accordingly, or set `'spellfile'` explicitly to their location (e.g. config).",
