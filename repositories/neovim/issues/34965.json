On small files I don't see the flickering. It happens more often when there is \"a lot\" of lua config, but the exact config doesn't seem to matter (probably this is related to how long it takes to refresh the display?). The reproduction below very rarely flickers because it has much less config, but it does still flicker (I changed it from CursorHold to CursorMoved to make it more likely).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```sh\nnvim --clean -u minimal.lua parse.clj\n# wait a few seconds for the lsp to attach; use :LspInfo to see progress or errors\n# move the cursor around a little bit, e.g. with hjkl.\n```\nwhere minimal.lua is:\n```lua\n  require('lspconfig')\n  vim.diagnostic.config({ virtual_text = true })\n  vim.lsp.enable('clojure_lsp')\n  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"LspAttach\", { callback = function(args)\n    local bufnr = args.buf\n    local client = vim.lsp.get_client_by_id(args.data.client_id)\n    if not client then return end\n    if client.server_capabilities.codeLensProvider then\n      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ \"CursorMoved\" }, {\n        callback = function() vim.lsp.codelens.refresh { bufnr = bufnr } end,\n        buffer = bufnr,\n      })\n    end\n  end })\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo flickering. I see that there was an intended fix in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/34888, but I tried with the latest master branch and still saw flickering.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.12.0-dev-834+gfcec1610e7\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nn/a, no codelens in base nvim\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nPop!_OS 22.04 LTS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ntmux next-3.6 (local fork) running in kitty 0.39.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuilt from source to test",
