    "body": "### Problem\n\nI originally reported this in https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server/issues/1047 but the YAML LSP maintainers said it's a Vim or Neovim issue. They pointed to this line of code: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/abc96ba0ce306ea162d1ceb5133d3b82d0558e2e/runtime/indent/yaml.vim#L17\n\nThe steps to reproduce explains the problem. I listed my OS and terminal here but I'm able to reproduce this problem on multiple systems and others are too.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`|` is going to represent your cursor. You can do this in a file called `demo.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nhello:\n  - a|\n\nworld: {}\n```\n\nIf you hit enter and type `-` to start the next item in the list you end up with this:\n\n```yaml\nhello:\n  - a\n- b\n\nworld: {}\n```\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n- If `world: {}` doesn't exist, then the indentation is correct\n- If the item is not the last item in the list (such as the middle, etc.) then the indentation is correct as long as the last item's indentation matches the first item\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```yaml\nhello:\n  - a\n  - b\n\nworld: {}\n```\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI don't know, I don't have Vim installed\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux though WSL 2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nMicrosoft Terminal 1.22.10731.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nArch's standard repo",
