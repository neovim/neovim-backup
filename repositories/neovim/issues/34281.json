    "body": "## Problem\n\nCurrently (with `require('vim._extui').enable({})`), there are still many cases where user now has to press \"q\", and we need to avoid those aggressively.\n\nThe Big Unlock of https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27811 is to avoid press-enter. That also means avoiding \"press q\". \n\nKey idea: no press-enter/press-q for mappings or commands, ever. Users that don't like this can enable the legacy press-enter behavior (which we can emulate with `vim._extui`, to a reasonable extent, at low cost).\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nFor all kinds of \"pager\" output, the user should never get trapped in the pager (the \"more\" window). We can address this in phases, as follows. As we discover problems with each stage, we can move to the next stage.\n\n### Phase 1\n\nThe pager should never be \"focused\" unless the user requests it via `g<`. Users need to get used to hitting `g<` to activate the pager. This includes all non-input message kinds, including `shell_cmd`, etc.\n\nFor example: when I use vim-fugitive `:Git commit`, I shouldn't have to exit the shell output. \n\n### Phase 2\n\nIntroduce a `'messagesheight'` (`'pagerheight'`?) option, instead of `'cmdheight'`. This controls the maximum height of text shown by default. The pager is still never focused by default, but output is shown up to 'messagesheight' and may overlay the current buffer. \n\n- The user cursor position remains in whatever buffer they were in when they invoked a mapping/command that triggered output. \n- The pager disappears on any kind of user input. It is not timer-based.\n\nAs always, if 'messagesheight' didn't show enough, the user hits `g<` to opt-in to the full pager.\n\n### Phase 3\n\nWe may want to special-case \"interactive\" commands that were invoked via the `:` cmdline. Maybe it's expected and more ergonomic that `g<` is not required here. I hope we can avoid this, but we can consider this if necessary. This approach won't help users that are using third-party command-invocation plugins (but those plugins can easily call `g<` by default).",

That and `list_cmd` kinds are the only messages that currently open the more window:\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/963308439a5dff5a55b837c74d0a50c2c069ae23/runtime/lua/vim/_extui/messages.lua#L363-L365\n\n> For example: when I use vim-fugitive :Git commit, I shouldn't have to exit the shell output.\n\nYeah this is unfortunate. The typed command detection would have to somehow exclude invoked plugin commands that emit messages using those \"inspection\" kinds. Only if the user types a command that directly emits a message should this happen.",
