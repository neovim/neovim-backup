    "body": "### Problem\n\nNeovim provides a `:checkhealth` feature for plugins and Neovim itself to show \"self-diagnostics\". This allows users to\n1. quickly see detectable problems and misconfigurations (\"runtime is missing\", \"parsers are broken\", \"server not executable\", \"TERM misconfigured\")\n2. information about the internal state (loaded treesitter parsers, active and inactive LSP configurations)\n\nWhile this information is very useful for bug reports and understanding why your Neovim behaves as it does, the increasing amount of information (especially around (nvim-)treesitter and LSP) makes it increasingly hard to navigate. So we need to add ways of structuring and navigating this information.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThere are several (independent) improvements that can be made, roughly in order of ascending complexity:\n\n* [Â ] Add a table of contents (`gO`, already supported for `help` buffers, which `checkhealth` inherits from).\n* [ ] Add section navigation via `]]` (which would also be useful for `help` buffers)\n* [ ] Add color to section headers (white/green for \"all clear\" or info only, orange if the section contains a warning, red if the section contains an error)\n* [ ] Add folding to sections (foldtext should be section header, colored as above). This is a bit controversial but a net win if\n   - `foldenable` is respected (so people can opt out of all folding);\n   - sections are either all folded or not folded by default;\n   - folding is not enabled if only a single section is shown (e.g., `:check lsp`).\n* [ ]  Only show the most important, actionable, health checks by default and reserve the full information for an \"extended view\" that can be toggled by either pressing, say, `D` in a `checkhealth` buffer or calling `:checkhealth!`.\n(This could be implemented by adding a flag to `vim.health.info` to indicate that the message should only be shown in extended mode. Bonus points for evaluating this lazily -- \"Treesitter parsers\", I'm thinking of you!)",
