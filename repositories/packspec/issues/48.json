    "body": "## Question\n\nDoes https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec overlap with packspec?\n\n> PURL introduces a standardized URL-based syntax that uniquely identifies software packages, independent of their ecosystem or distribution channel. Unlike traditional identification methods, PURL embeds critical metadata directly into its structure, enabling efficient, accurate package identification at scale. This standardization ensures interoperability between tools and ecosystems, fostering greater collaboration and reducing ambiguity in software supply chain management.\n\n> Challenges addressed by PURL:\n>\n> - Ambiguity in Package Identification\n> - Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability\n> - Enhanced Traceability and Risk Management\n> - Tooling and Automation\n\nPURL is gaining traction for creating Attribution Documents, aka Open Source Package Inventory (OSPI) files, to document licenses of dependencies used by software.\n\nSee also https://github.com/Xpertians/xmonkey-namonica\n\n### Example PURLs\n\n```\npkg:deb/debian/curl@7.50.3-1?arch=i386&distro=jessie\npkg:docker/cassandra@sha256:244fd47e07d1004f0aed9c\npkg:pypi/django@1.11.1\npkg:rpm/fedora/curl@7.50.3-1.fc25?arch=i386&distro=fedora-25\npkg:rpm/opensuse/curl@7.56.1-1.1.?arch=i386&distro=opensuse-tumbleweed\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThere is some overlap. Though it may not gain traction for declaring \"ad hoc URL-driven dependencies\" since (1) generating the canonical PURL is not easy, and (2) the tooling required to fetch the dep is heterogenous (not \"just a git repo\").",
