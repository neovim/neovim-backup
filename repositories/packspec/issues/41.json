Supporting ~~all Lua-supporting versions of Vim/Nvim~~ _all \"assets\" or \"artifacts\" of any kind_ in the spec should be a requirement. \r\n    - No need for Vim/Nvim to have a different package spec, plus this adds legitimacy and weight to the idea.\r\n    - No need for this spec to be specific to vim or text editors. What's needed is simply a way to define [artifacts that depend on other artifacts.](https://sink.io/jmk/artifact-system)\r\n1. Shrink the scope by at least 2x.\r\n    - ~~Only support one format, Lua (because it allows comments). Vim must be compiled with `+lua` or must have `lua` available on $PATH.~~\r\n    - Only support one format, JSON. Because:\r\n        - ubiquitous\r\n        - \"machine readable\" (sandboxed by design): can recursively download an entire dependency tree before executing any code, including hooks. Aggregators such as https://neovimcraft.com/ can consume it.\r\n        - Turing-complete formats invite endless special-case features (nvim-lspconfig is a [living example](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/2595)).\r\n    - Remove any fields that are not immediately, obviously needed. \r\n        - **Remove any fields that are provided by git. _Git is a client requirement._**\r\n        - But keep anything that is needed to ensure forward-compatible enhancements.\r\n1. (optional) use identical field names from npm's `package.json`, where possible (assuming this reduces confusion rather than increasing it)\r\n1. Strict \"no side-effects\" requirement:  `pkg.json` should be totally sandboxed (evaluating it must have no side-effects, only input and output). ~~(Does [#7](https://github.com/nvim-lua/nvim-package-specification/issues/7) address this?)~~\r\n1. Transfer this repo to https://github.com/neovim/ ?\r\n\r\n# Client requirements\r\n\r\n- `git` (packages can live at any git URL)\r\n- json parser\r\n\r\n# Package server requirements\r\n\r\n- the package URL must be a `git` repo\r\n\r\n# What about LuaRocks?\r\n\r\nI've advocated for LuaRocks as the Nvim plugin manager, but defining a ~~\"plugin spec\"~~ \"federated package spec\" also makes sense because:\r\n\r\n- There is no \"federated\" plugin spec (corrections welcome!). LuaRocks is a \"centralized\" approach.\r\n- LuaRocks + Nvim is starting to see real progress in the form of https://github.com/nvim-neorocks , but thus far has not gained momentum. A decentralized, lowest-common-denominator, \"infectious\" approach is high-leverage, while work continues on the centralized LuaRocks approach at its own pace.\r\n- There's no central _asset_ registry, just a bunch of URLs. \r\n    - Could have a central _list_ of plugins, but not assets.\r\n- We can do both, at low cost. `pkg.json` is a fairly \"cheap\" approach. LuaRocks\r\n- Luarocks itself is a somewhat complex dependency. Nvim removed it from its own build:\r\n    - \"luarocks is very slow, its servers unreliable, and its caching mechanism is straight up broken.\" [ref](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/25070) [ref](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/f30844008bdd313b03a19486159f571a067e68b9) \r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n- https://json-schema.org/\r\n- lazy.nvim [pkg.json impl](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/pull/910/files#diff-eeb8f2e48ace6e2f4c40bf159b7f59e5eb1208e056a3f9f1b9cc6822ecb45371)",

            "body": "# Revised, minimal package spec: `pkg.json`\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"lspconfig\", // OPTIONAL cosmetic name, not used for resolution nor filesystem locations.\r\n  \"description\" : \"Quickstart configurations for the Nvim-lsp client\", // OPTIONAL\r\n  \"engines\": {\r\n      \"nvim\": \"^0.10.0\",\r\n      \"vim\": \"^9.1.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"repository\": { // REQUIRED\r\n      \"type\": \"git\", // reserved for future use\r\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\" : { // OPTIONAL\r\n    \"https://github.com/neovim/neovim\" : \"0.6.1\",\r\n    \"https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim\" : \"0.3\"\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Dependencies (\"leaf nodes\") aren't required to have a `pkg.json` file. Only required for \"downstream\".\r\n    - `pkg.json` can declare a dependency on any random artifact fetchable by URL. The upstream dependency doesn't need a `pkg.json`.\r\n- Version specifiers in `dependencies` follow the [NPM version range spec](https://devhints.io/semver) ~~[cargo spec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html)~~\r\n    - Supported by Nvim `vim.version.range()`.\r\n    - Extensions to npm version spec:\r\n        - `\"HEAD\"` means git HEAD. (npm version spec defines `\"\"` and `\"*\"` as latest stable version.)\r\n    - ~~Do NOT support \"Combined ranges\".~~\r\n    - Treat any string of length >=7 and lacking \".\" as a commit-id.\r\n    - Only support commit-id, tags, and HEAD.\r\n    - Tags must contain a non-alphanumeric char.\r\n- Out of scope:\r\n    - \"pack\" (creating a package)\r\n    - \"publish\" is out of scope, because `pkg.json` is decentralized. Publishing a package means pushing it to a git repo with a top-level `pkg.json`.\r\n    - \"uninstall\" https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#a-note-on-a-lack-of-npm-uninstall-scripts\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- renamed `packspec.json` to `pkg.json`  ~~`deps.json`~~ (to hint that it's basically a subset of NPM's `package.json`)\r\n- removed `\"version\" : \"0.1.2\",` because package version is provided by the `.git` repo info\r\n- removed `external_dependencies`\r\n- removed `specification_version`. The lack of a \"spec version\" field means the spec version is `1.0.0`. If breaking changes are ever needed then we could introduce a \"spec version\" field.\r\n- renamed `\"source\" : \"git:…\",` to `repository.url`\r\n- renamed `package` to `name` (to align with NPM)\r\n- changed the shape of `description` from object to string (to align with NPM)\r\n- changed `dependencies` shape to align with NPM. Except the keys are URLs.\r\n    - Leaves the door open for non-URL keys in the future.\r\n\r\n## Closed questions\r\n\r\n- Top-level application-defined \"metadata\" field (`client`, `user`, `metadata`, ...?) for use by clients (package managers)?\r\n    - `pkg.json` allows arbitrary application-defined fields, as `package.json` does.\r\n- \"Ecosystem-agnostic\" means that https://luarocks.org packages can't be consumed?\r\n    - If Nvim plugins can successfully use luarocks then `pkg.json` is redundant. `pkg.json` is only useful for ecosystems that don't have centralized package management.\r\n- Are git submodules/subtrees a viable solution for git-only dependency trees?\r\n    - https://stackoverflow.com/a/61961021/152142\r\n    - pro: avoids another package/deps format\r\n    - con:\r\n        - not easy for package authors to implement (run `git` commands instead of editing a json file)\r\n        - no `engines` field: how will aggregators build a package list?\r\n        - no support for non-git blobs\r\n- Does the lack of a `version` field mean that a manifest file always tracks HEAD of the git repo?\r\n    - The dependents declare what version they need, which must be available as a git tag in the dependency. Thus no need for `pkg.json` to repeat that information. The reason that `package.json` and other package formats need a `version` field is because they _don't_ require a `.git` repo to be present.\r\n- Should consumers of dependencies need to control how a dependency is resolved?\r\n    - `repository.type` is available for future use if we want to deal with that.\r\n- It'd be nice if the spec enforces globally unique names... Then `dependencies` could look like `{ \"dependencies\": { \"plenary.nvim\": \"1.0.0\" } }`\r\n    - Requiring URIs achieves that, without a central registry.\r\n- Should `name` be removed? Because `repository.url` already defines the \"name\" (which can be prettified in UIs).\r\n    - Defined `name` as OPTIONAL and strictly cosmetic (not used for programmatic decisions or filesystem paths).\r\n- `package.json` has an [`engines` field](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) that declares what software can _run_ the package. Example:\r\n  ```\r\n  \"engines\": {\r\n      \"vscode\": \"^1.71.0\"\r\n  },\r\n- How to deal with dependencies moving to a new host? Should `pkg.json` support \"fallback\" URLs?\r\n    - The downstream must update its URLs.\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n- via @folke: most important to ideally be in the spec:\r\n    - ✅ dependencies\r\n    - ❓ metadata probably makes sense, NPM itself allows arbitrary fields in `package.json`\r\n    - ❓ build\r\n    - ❓whether the plugin needs/supports setup()\r\n    - ❓main module for the plugin (lazy currently figures that out automatically, but would be better to have this part of the spec)\r\n- Can `pkg.json` be a strict subset of NPM `package.json` ? The ability to validate it with https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-package-json is attractive...\r\n- Non-git dependencies (\"blobs\"): require version specifier to be object (instead of string):\r\n    - `\"https://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/libvterm-0.3.2.tar.gz\": { \"type\": \"tar+gzip\", \"version\": \"…\" }`\r\n    - How can a package manager know the blob has been updated if there's no git info? (Answer: undefined.)\r\n- `scripts` and \"build-time\" tasks ([lifecycle](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-operation-order))\r\n    - Scripts must be array of strings (unlike npm package.json).\r\n    - Scripts are run from the root of the package folder, regardless of what the current working directory is.\r\n    - Predefined script names and lifecycle order:\r\n        - These all run after fetching and writing the package contents to the engine-defined package path, in order.\r\n        - `preinstall`\r\n        - `install`\r\n        - `postinstall`\r\n- Naming conflict: what happens if `https://github.com/.../foo` and `https://sr.ht/.../foo` are in the dependency tree?\r\n  ```\r\n   .local/share/nvim/site/pack/github.com/start/\r\n   .local/share/nvim/site/pack/sr.ht/start/\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Strategy\r\n\r\n- [x] specify packspec (above)\r\n- [ ] specify ecosystem-agnostic client behavior (report conflicts, fetch things into `pack/` dir, update existing dir, ...)\r\n- [ ] specify what is undefined (i.e. owned by the per-ecosystem \"engine\", for example vim/nvim packages are fetched into 'packpath')",

            "body": "Cool! I'll add some of my thoughts, hope you don't mind;\r\n\r\n> * removed `\"version\" : \"0.1.2\",` because package version is provided by the `.git` repo info\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that a manifest file always tracks HEAD of the git repo? Given a manifest file as input, how would one know which version of the package it describes? I think the version number in the manifest file is very much needed, and should be the canonical version identifier. I also feel like the absence of the version number would violate the 4th principle?\r\n\r\n> * renamed `specification_version` to `specversion`\r\n\r\nI think excluding this field would help with overall ergonomics. If the spec starts out small with only fundamental requirements and additions are carefully considered I don't see the spec schema changing in such a way it'd require a spec version bump. Bumping the spec version should imo be a last resort. I think a strict non-breaking change policy would make sense. Consumers would simply check the presence of a field to enable that \"feature\".\r\n\r\n> * changed `dependencies` shape to align with NPM. Except the keys are URLs.\r\n>   \r\n>   * Leaves the door open for non-URL keys in the future.\r\n\r\nShould consumers of dependencies need to control how a dependency is resolved? I think it'd be nice if the spec enforces globally unique names instead which central registries would have to enforce. The dependency schema could then simply be:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"plenary.nvim\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for describing version ranges, it looks like the suggested syntax employs npm's syntax, which I think is entirely proprietary to npm. I think cargo's approach is a bit simpler, where:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.2.3  :=  >=1.2.3, <2.0.0\r\n1.2    :=  >=1.2.0, <2.0.0\r\n1      :=  >=1.0.0, <2.0.0\r\n0.2.3  :=  >=0.2.3, <0.3.0\r\n0.2    :=  >=0.2.0, <0.3.0\r\n0.0.3  :=  >=0.0.3, <0.0.4\r\n0.0    :=  >=0.0.0, <0.1.0\r\n0      :=  >=0.0.0, <1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel like this alone is enough? In the future it could be extended with the additional modifiers `~`, `^` and `*` (which have [different meaning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html) than in npm).\r\n\r\n> Dependencies aren't required to have a packspec.json file. That's only required for the \"leaf nodes\".\r\n\r\nI think the entire dependency tree should be \"packspec-enabled\". Having plugin dependencies is in my experience pretty rare (maybe only a contemporary consequence of the lack of a manifest file), and those who do tend to depend on plugins that are intended to be dependent on (e.g. `plenary`) - it'd be in everyone's interest for them to provide a manifest. Having this requirement could also act as a motivator for authors to include one. It's also a hygiene and stability factor as it'd hinder \"nonserious\" plugins from making their way into the package ecosystem - it's a good proxy for signaling stability.\r\n\r\nFinally I think it'd also be good to explicitly define which fields are required. I don't see it being mentioned here but I feel like there's an implication that some of them currently are?",
